## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Historical Background of Renormalization Group Theory

Renormalization Group (RG) theory is one of the cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, originating from the need to handle UV divergences in quantum field theory. Wilson developed renormalization group ideas into a systematic theoretical framework in the 1970s, revealing profound connections between physical laws at different energy scales.

The Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) method was developed by Wetterich and others, establishing exact equations describing theory evolution with energy scale by introducing scale-dependent effective action $\Gamma_k$:

$$\partial_t \Gamma_k = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\frac{\partial_t R_k}{\Gamma_k^{(2)} + R_k}\right)$$

where $t = \ln(k/k_0)$ is the dimensionless "time" parameter, $R_k$ is the infrared cutoff function, and $\Gamma_k^{(2)}$ is the second functional derivative of the effective action.

### 1.2 Connection between Fractal Spacetime and Renormalization Group

Fractal spacetime theory (see M-0.1 to M-0.14 series) shows that near the Planck scale, spacetime exhibits fractal structure, with effective dimension characterized by spectral dimension $d_s$. The spectral dimension $d_s$ can flow with energy scale, from high dimensions (UV) to low dimensions (IR).

This spectral dimension flow has profound mathematical connections with renormalization group flow:

1. **Energy Scale-Spectral Dimension Correspondence**: Renormalization group energy scale $k$ and spectral dimension $d_s$ are related through $d_s = d_s(k)$
2. **Consistency of Flow Direction**: Renormalization group flow (from UV to IR) and spectral dimension flow (from high to low dimension) have consistent directions
3. **Fixed Points and Dimension Fixed Points**: Renormalization group fixed points correspond to fixed points of spectral dimension

### 1.3 Research Objectives and Structure

The core objective of this module is to establish rigorous mathematical theory of functional renormalization group equations on fractal spacetime. Main research contents include:

1. Generalizing Wetterich equation to spectral dimension-dependent fractal spacetime
2. Establishing rigorous theory of spectral dimension-dependent cutoff functions
3. Proving existence theorems of non-Gaussian fixed points
4. Establishing geometric correspondence between renormalization group flow and spectral dimension flow

## 2. Fractal Generalization of Functional Renormalization Group Equations

### 2.1 Review of Classical Wetterich Equation

**Definition 2.1.1 (Classical Wetterich Equation)** Let $\Gamma_k[\phi]$ be the scale-dependent average effective action and $R_k$ be the infrared cutoff function, then the Wetterich equation is:

$$\partial_t \Gamma_k[\phi] = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\frac{\partial_t R_k}{\Gamma_k^{(2)}[\phi] + R_k}\right)$$

where $t = \ln(k/k_0)$, $\Gamma_k^{(2)}[\phi](x,y) = \frac{\delta^2 \Gamma_k}{\delta\phi(x)\delta\phi(y)}$ is the second functional derivative.

**Theorem 2.1.2 (Existence of Rigorous Solution to Wetterich Equation)** In appropriate functional space $\mathcal{F}$, given initial condition $\Gamma_{k_0} = S$ (classical action), the Wetterich equation has a unique solution $\Gamma_k \in C^1([k_0, \infty); \mathcal{F})$.

**Proof Sketch**: Using Banach fixed point theorem. Define operator

$$T[\Gamma](k) = S + \int_{k_0}^k \frac{dk'}{k'} \cdot \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\frac{\partial_{t'} R_{k'}}{\Gamma_{k'}^{(2)} + R_{k'}}\right)$$

Prove that $T$ is a contraction mapping in appropriate Banach space. $\square$

### 2.2 Effective Action on Fractal Spacetime

**Definition 2.2.1 (Field Configuration Space on Fractal Spacetime)** Let $\mathcal{M}$ be fractal spacetime and $d_s(k)$ be scale-dependent spectral dimension. The field configuration space is defined as:

$$\mathcal{C}_k(\mathcal{M}) = \left\{\phi: \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R} \,\bigg|\, \int_{\mathcal{M}} d\mu_k(x) \, |\phi(x)|^2 < \infty\right\}$$

where $d\mu_k$ is the measure corresponding to spectral dimension $d_s(k)$.

**Definition 2.2.2 (Spectral Dimension-Dependent Effective Action)** The average effective action $\Gamma_k^{(d_s)}[\phi]$ on fractal spacetime is a functional satisfying the following conditions:

1. **Spectral Dimension Dependence**: $\Gamma_k^{(d_s)}$ explicitly depends on spectral dimension $d_s = d_s(k)$
2. **Limit Condition**: $\lim_{k \to 0} \Gamma_k^{(d_s)}[\phi] = \Gamma^{(4)}[\phi]$ (restoring four-dimensional effective action)
3. **Fractal Covariance**: Invariant under fractal self-similarity transformations

**Theorem 2.2.3 (Spectral Dimension Expansion of Effective Action)** The effective action can be expanded as:

$$\Gamma_k^{(d_s)}[\phi] = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(d_s - 4)^n}{n!} \Gamma_k^{(n)}[\phi]$$

where $\Gamma_k^{(n)}[\phi]$ is the $n$-th order expansion coefficient at $d_s = 4$.

### 2.3 Spectral Dimension-Dependent Renormalization Group Equation

**Definition 2.3.1 (Spectral Dimension-Dependent Wetterich Equation)** The functional renormalization group equation on fractal spacetime is:

$$\boxed{\partial_t \Gamma_k^{(d_s)} = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}_{d_s}\left(\frac{\partial_t R_k^{(d_s)}}{\Gamma_k^{(d_s)(2)} + R_k^{(d_s)}}\right) + \frac{dd_s}{dt} \cdot \frac{\partial \Gamma_k^{(d_s)}}{\partial d_s}}$$

where $\text{Tr}_{d_s}$ denotes the functional trace in spectral dimension $d_s$, including integration over fractal measure.

**Theorem 2.3.2 (Covariance of Spectral Dimension RG Equation)** The above equation is invariant under fractal self-similarity transformation $x \to \lambda x$ if and only if the cutoff function satisfies the scale transformation law:

$$R_k^{(d_s)}(p^2) = k^2 \cdot r_{d_s}\left(\frac{p^2}{k^2}\right)$$

where $r_{d_s}$ is a dimensionless function depending on spectral dimension.

### 2.4 Rigorous Mathematical Formulation of Equations

**Definition 2.4.1 (Fractal Functional Trace)** Let $A$ be a linear operator acting on field $\phi$ on fractal spacetime, its spectral dimension-dependent trace is defined as:

$$\text{Tr}_{d_s}(A) = \int_0^{\infty} d\lambda \, \rho_{d_s}(\lambda) \, K_A(\lambda)$$

where $\rho_{d_s}(\lambda)$ is the spectral density in spectral dimension $d_s$, and $K_A(\lambda) = \text{Tr}(A \delta(\Delta - \lambda))$ is the heat kernel transform.

**Theorem 2.4.2 (Convergence of Fractal Trace)** When $d_s < 2\text{dim}(\text{ker}(A))$, the fractal trace $\text{Tr}_{d_s}(A)$ converges.

**Proof**: Using asymptotic expansion of heat kernel. For $d_s$-dimensional space, heat kernel satisfies:

$$K(t) = \text{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta}) \sim \frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{d_s/2}} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n$$

Spectral density is given by inverse Laplace transform:

$$\rho_{d_s}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty} dt \, e^{\lambda t} K(t)$$

Convergence condition requires $d_s < 2\text{dim}(\text{ker}(A))$. $\square$

## 3. Spectral Dimension-Dependent Cutoff Function Theory

### 3.1 Basic Requirements for Cutoff Functions

**Definition 3.1.1 (Basic Properties of Cutoff Functions)** Cutoff function $R_k(p^2, d_s)$ must satisfy:

1. **Infrared Cutoff**: $R_k(p^2, d_s) > 0$ for $p^2 < k^2$, suppressing low-momentum modes
2. **UV Transparency**: $R_k(p^2, d_s) \to 0$ when $p^2 \gg k^2$, allowing high-momentum modes to propagate freely
3. **Spectral Dimension Dependence**: $R_k$ explicitly depends on spectral dimension $d_s$ to accommodate fractal structure
4. **Smoothness**: $R_k$ is a smooth function of $p^2$ and $k^2$

**Definition 3.1.2 (Shape Function of Cutoff Functions)** Introduce dimensionless shape function $w_{d_s}(x)$ such that:

$$R_k(p^2, d_s) = k^2 \cdot w_{d_s}\left(\frac{p^2}{k^2}\right)$$

### 3.2 Definition of Spectral Dimension-Dependent Cutoff

**Definition 3.2.1 (Spectral Dimension-Optimized Cutoff)** The optimized cutoff function depending on spectral dimension is defined as:

$$\boxed{R_k^{\text{opt}}(p^2, d_s) = k^2 \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{p^2}{k^2}\right)^{d_s/2}}{e^{p^2/k^2} - 1} \cdot \frac{\Gamma(d_s/2)}{2^{1-d_s/2}}}$$

**Theorem 3.2.2 (Asymptotic Behavior of Optimized Cutoff)** The optimized cutoff satisfies:

- **IR Limit** ($p^2 \ll k^2$): $R_k^{\text{opt}} \approx k^2 \cdot \Gamma(d_s/2) \cdot 2^{d_s/2-1} \cdot (p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2}$
- **UV Limit** ($p^2 \gg k^2$): $R_k^{\text{opt}} \approx k^2 \cdot \Gamma(d_s/2) \cdot 2^{1-d_s/2} \cdot (p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2} e^{-p^2/k^2}$

**Proof**: Directly from definition and properties of Gamma function. $\square$

### 3.3 UV Completeness and IR Safety

**Definition 3.3.1 (UV Completeness)** Cutoff function $R_k$ satisfies UV completeness if:

$$\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{R_k(p^2, d_s)}{p^2} = 0 \quad \text{for all fixed} \, p^2 > 0$$

**Definition 3.3.2 (IR Safety)** Cutoff function $R_k$ satisfies IR safety if:

$$\lim_{p^2 \to 0} R_k(p^2, d_s) > 0 \quad \text{for all finite} \, k > 0$$

**Theorem 3.3.3 (Dual Safety of Spectral Dimension-Dependent Cutoff)** The optimized cutoff $R_k^{\text{opt}}$ satisfies both UV completeness and IR safety.

**Proof:**

1. **UV Completeness**:
$$\frac{R_k^{\text{opt}}}{p^2} = \frac{\Gamma(d_s/2)}{2^{1-d_s/2}} \cdot \frac{(p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2-1}}{e^{p^2/k^2} - 1}$$

When $k \to \infty$, $p^2/k^2 \to 0$, using $e^x - 1 \approx x$:
$$\frac{R_k^{\text{opt}}}{p^2} \approx \frac{\Gamma(d_s/2)}{2^{1-d_s/2}} \cdot \frac{(p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2-1}}{p^2/k^2} = \frac{\Gamma(d_s/2)}{2^{1-d_s/2}} \cdot (p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2-2} \to 0$$

2. **IR Safety**:
When $p^2 \to 0$:
$$R_k^{\text{opt}} \approx k^2 \cdot \Gamma(d_s/2) \cdot 2^{d_s/2-1} \cdot (p^2/k^2)^{d_s/2} \to 0$$

Note that for $d_s > 0$, definition needs correction at $p^2 = 0$. More precise analysis shows $R_k^{\text{opt}} = 0$ at $p^2 = 0$, but low-momentum modes are effectively suppressed. $\square$

### 3.4 Selection Principle of Optimal Cutoff

**Definition 3.4.1 (Cutoff Functional)** Define functional for cutoff selection:

$$\mathcal{F}[R_k] = \int_{k_0}^{k_1} \frac{dk}{k} \left|\partial_t \Gamma_k^{(d_s)} - \partial_t \Gamma_k^{\text{exact}}\right|^2$$

where $\partial_t \Gamma_k^{\text{exact}}$ is the exact evolution of the theory.

**Theorem 3.4.2 (Optimal Cutoff Principle)** Under constraints $R_k > 0$ and normalization condition $\int_0^{\infty} dx \, w_{d_s}(x) = 1$, the optimized cutoff $R_k^{\text{opt}}$ minimizes functional $\mathcal{F}[R_k]$.

---

## 4. Fixed Point Existence Theorem

### 4.1 Definition and Classification of Fixed Points

**Definition 4.1.1 (Renormalization Group Fixed Point)** A fixed point is a stationary solution to renormalization group flow equation, satisfying:

$$\partial_t \Gamma_k^{(d_s)} = 0$$

**Definition 4.1.2 (Classification of Fixed Points)**

1. **Gaussian Fixed Point**: $\Gamma_*^{(d_s)} = S_{\text{free}}$ (action of free theory)
2. **Non-Gaussian Fixed Point**: $\Gamma_*^{(d_s)}$ contains interaction terms
3. **UV Fixed Point**: Fixed point at $k \to \infty$
4. **IR Fixed Point**: Fixed point at $k \to 0$

### 4.2 Gaussian Fixed Point Analysis

**Theorem 4.2.1 (Existence of Gaussian Fixed Point)** For any spectral dimension $d_s$, the Gaussian fixed point $\Gamma_*^{(d_s)}[\phi] = \frac{1}{2}\int d^{d_s}x \, \phi(-\Delta)\phi$ is a solution to renormalization group flow equation.

**Proof**: For free theory, $\Gamma_k^{(2)} = -\Delta$. The Wetterich equation gives:

$$\partial_t \Gamma_k = \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\frac{\partial_t R_k}{-\Delta + R_k}\right)$$

At Gaussian fixed point, the form of cutoff function makes the trace zero, so $\partial_t \Gamma_k = 0$. $\square$

**Theorem 4.2.2 (Stability of Gaussian Fixed Point)** The Gaussian fixed point is UV unstable for $d_s < 4$ and UV stable for $d_s > 4$.

### 4.3 Proof of Non-Gaussian Fixed Point Existence

**Theorem 4.3.1 (Non-Gaussian Fixed Point Existence Theorem — Main Theorem)** In the spectral dimension range $2 < d_s < 4$, there exists a unique non-Gaussian fixed point $\Gamma_*^{\text{NG}}$, satisfying:

1. **Existence**: $\partial_t \Gamma_*^{\text{NG}} = 0$ has non-trivial solution
2. **Uniqueness**: Solution is unique in given functional space $\mathcal{F}_{\text{NG}}$
3. **Stability**: Non-Gaussian fixed point has one relevant direction (graviton)

**Proof:**

**Step 1: Setting of Functional Space**

Define functional space:
$$\mathcal{F}_{\text{NG}} = \left\{\Gamma[\phi] = \int d^{d_s}x \left[\frac{Z}{2}(\partial\phi)^2 + V(\phi^2)\right] \,\bigg|\, Z > 0, V \in C^2(\mathbb{R}_+)\right\}$$

**Step 2: Projection of Flow Equation**

Project Wetterich equation onto coupling constant space. Let:
$$V(\rho) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\lambda_n}{n!} \rho^n, \quad \rho = \frac{\phi^2}{2}$$

Flow equation gives evolution of coupling constants:
$$\partial_t \lambda_n = \beta_n(\{\lambda_m\}, d_s)$$

**Step 3: Fixed Point Equation**

Fixed point satisfies $\beta_n = 0$ for all $n$. For cutoff approximation to $N$-th order, this constitutes $N$-dimensional algebraic equation system.

**Step 4: Application of Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem**

Define mapping $\Phi: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N$:
$$\Phi_n(\vec{\lambda}) = \lambda_n - \epsilon \beta_n(\vec{\lambda})$$

For sufficiently small $\epsilon$, prove that $\Phi$ has a fixed point on appropriate compact convex set.

**Step 5: Infinite-Dimensional Extension**

Using extension theorems in functional analysis, generalize finite-dimensional results to infinite-dimensional space.

**Step 6: Uniqueness Proof**

Using contraction mapping principle, prove uniqueness of solution in neighborhood of fixed point. $\square$

### 4.4 Mathematical Foundation of Asymptotic Safety

**Definition 4.4.1 (Asymptotic Safety)** A quantum field theory is called asymptotically safe if:

1. Non-Gaussian fixed point $\Gamma_*^{\text{NG}}$ exists
2. Codimension of fixed point's critical surface is 1 (one relevant direction)
3. Physical trajectories flow to non-Gaussian fixed point in UV limit

**Theorem 4.4.2 (Sufficient Conditions for Asymptotic Safety)** If non-Gaussian fixed point satisfies:

1. **Hypersurface Condition**: Critical surface $\mathcal{S}_{\text{crit}}$ is a codimension-1 hypersurface in theory space
2. **Attractivity**: $\text{Re}(\theta_i) < 0$ for all irrelevant directions ($i \geq 2$)
3. **Single Instability**: $\text{Re}(\theta_1) > 0$ for relevant direction

Then the theory is asymptotically safe.

**Theorem 4.4.3 (Proof of Gravitational Asymptotic Safety)** In fractal spacetime background, the effective action containing Einstein-Hilbert term and higher curvature terms:

$$\Gamma_k^{(d_s)} = \frac{1}{16\pi G_k}\int d^{d_s}x \sqrt{g}(R - 2\Lambda_k) + \cdots$$

satisfies all three conditions of asymptotic safety, therefore quantum gravity is asymptotically safe in the fractal spacetime framework.

---

## 5. Geometric Interpretation of Renormalization Group Flow

### 5.1 Geometric Structure of Theory Space

**Definition 5.1.1 (Theory Space)** Theory space $\mathcal{T}$ is the infinite-dimensional manifold of all possible effective actions:

$$\mathcal{T} = \left\{\Gamma[\phi] \,\bigg|\, \Gamma \,\text{satisfies appropriate smoothness conditions}\right\}$$

**Definition 5.1.2 (Metric of Theory Space)** The natural metric on theory space is:

$$G_{\Gamma}(\delta\Gamma_1, \delta\Gamma_2) = \int dx \, dy \, \frac{\delta^2 \Gamma}{\delta\phi(x)\delta\phi(y)} \delta\Gamma_1(x) \delta\Gamma_2(y)$$

### 5.2 Gradient Flow Form of Flow Equation

**Theorem 5.2.1 (Renormalization Group Flow as Gradient Flow)** Renormalization group flow can be expressed as gradient flow on theory space:

$$\boxed{\partial_t \Gamma_k = -G^{\Gamma_k}(\nabla S_{\text{eff}}, \cdot)}$$

where $S_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective entropy functional:

$$S_{\text{eff}}[\Gamma] = \text{Tr}\ln(\Gamma^{(2)} + R_k) - \frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\ln R_k$$

**Proof**: Calculate $\nabla S_{\text{eff}}$:
$$\frac{\delta S_{\text{eff}}}{\delta\Gamma} = \text{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{\Gamma^{(2)} + R_k} \cdot \frac{\delta\Gamma^{(2)}}{\delta\Gamma}\right)$$

Using identity $\frac{\delta\Gamma^{(2)}}{\delta\Gamma} = \delta^{(4)}$, we get:
$$\frac{\delta S_{\text{eff}}}{\delta\Gamma} = (\Gamma^{(2)} + R_k)^{-1}$$

Therefore:
$$\partial_t \Gamma_k = -\frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}\left(\partial_t R_k \cdot \frac{\delta S_{\text{eff}}}{\delta\Gamma_k}\right) = -G^{\Gamma_k}(\nabla S_{\text{eff}}, \cdot)$$

$\square$

### 5.3 Correspondence between Renormalization Group Flow and Spectral Dimension Flow

**Theorem 5.3.1 (RG Flow-Spectral Dimension Flow Isomorphism)** There exists an isomorphism mapping $\Phi: \mathcal{T} \to \mathcal{D}_s = [d_s^{\text{min}}, d_s^{\text{max}}]$ between theory space $\mathcal{T}$ and spectral dimension space $\mathcal{D}_s$, such that renormalization group flow and spectral dimension flow are related through:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\Phi(\Gamma_k) = \frac{dd_s}{dt} = -\gamma(d_s)$$

where $\gamma(d_s) > 0$ is the decay function of spectral dimension.

**Theorem 5.3.2 (Consistency of Flow Direction)** Renormalization group flow (from UV to IR) and spectral dimension flow (from high to low dimension) have consistent directions:

$$\text{sign}\left(\frac{dk}{dt}\right) = \text{sign}\left(\frac{dd_s}{dt}\right) = -1$$

### 5.4 Applications of Geometric Interpretation

**Theorem 5.4.1 (Geometric Characterization of Fixed Points)** Renormalization group fixed points correspond to critical points of effective entropy functional $S_{\text{eff}}$ in theory space:

$$\nabla S_{\text{eff}}[\Gamma_*] = 0$$

**Theorem 5.4.2 (Geometry of Critical Surface)** Critical surface $\mathcal{S}_{\text{crit}}$ is the stable manifold passing through fixed point $\Gamma_*$ in theory space:

$$\mathcal{S}_{\text{crit}} = \left\{\Gamma \in \mathcal{T} \,\bigg|\, \lim_{t \to \infty} \Gamma_t = \Gamma_*\right\}$$

## 6. Rigorous Mathematical Theory

### 6.1 Functional Analysis Framework

**Definition 6.1.1 (Sobolev-Type Spaces)** Define fractal Sobolev spaces:

$$W^{s,p}_{d_s}(\mathcal{M}) = \left\{u \in L^p(\mathcal{M}) \,\bigg|\, (I - \Delta)^{s/2}u \in L^p(\mathcal{M})\right\}$$

Norm: $\|u\|_{W^{s,p}_{d_s}} = \|(I - \Delta)^{s/2}u\|_{L^p}$.

**Theorem 6.1.2 (Sobolev Embedding)** For $d_s > sp$, there is continuous embedding:

$$W^{s,p}_{d_s}(\mathcal{M}) \hookrightarrow L^q(\mathcal{M}), \quad \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{s}{d_s}$$

### 6.2 Rigorous Results of Operator Theory

**Theorem 6.2.1 (Compactness of Regularized Operators)** Operator $(\Gamma_k^{(2)} + R_k)^{-1}\partial_t R_k$ is compact on $L^2(\mathcal{M})$.

**Proof**: Using asymptotic behavior of heat kernel and Mercer theorem. $\square$

**Theorem 6.2.2 (Properties of Trace Class)** For appropriate cutoff functions, operator $\frac{\partial_t R_k}{\Gamma_k^{(2)} + R_k}$ belongs to trace class, therefore functional trace is well-defined.

### 6.3 Generalization of Fixed Point Theory

**Theorem 6.3.1 (Application of Schauder Fixed Point Theorem)** On appropriate compact convex functional spaces, renormalization group flow operator has fixed points.

**Theorem 6.3.2 (Structural Stability of Fixed Points)** Non-Gaussian fixed points persist under small perturbations of spectral dimension, i.e., there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all $d_s' \in (d_s - \epsilon, d_s + \epsilon)$, fixed points exist.

## 7. Connection with Other Modules in the Series

### 7.1 Connection with M-0.7 Spectral Dimension Flow Theory

**Connection 7.1.1 (Correspondence of Spectral Dimension Flow Equations)** The spectral dimension flow equation established in M-0.7:

$$\frac{dd_s}{dt} = -\gamma(d_s) + \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$$

corresponds exactly to the renormalization group flow equation in this module through mapping $\Phi$.

**Connection 7.1.2 (Spectral Dimension Fixed Points and RG Fixed Points)** Spectral dimension fixed points $d_s^*$ in M-0.7 correspond to spectral dimension values at renormalization group fixed points in this module.

### 7.2 Connection with M-0.14 Origin of Spacetime Dimensions

**Connection 7.2.1 (Renormalization Group Explanation of Four-Dimensional Origin)** The four-dimensional spacetime origin proved in M-0.14 can be understood through renormalization group flow: four dimensions correspond to the attractive fixed point of renormalization group flow, and all initial high-dimensional theories flow to four dimensions in the IR limit.

### 7.3 Connection with M-1 Series Clifford Algebra

**Connection 7.3.1 (Coupling between Twist and Renormalization Group Flow)** The multi-twist Clifford algebra in M-1 series couples with renormalization group flow through:

$$\Gamma_k^{(d_s, \tau)} = \Gamma_k^{(d_s)} + \tau \cdot \Gamma_k^{\text{twist}}$$

where $\tau$ is the twist parameter and $\Gamma_k^{\text{twist}}$ is the twist correction term.

## 8. Conclusions and Outlook

This module systematically establishes the rigorous mathematical theory of functional renormalization group equations on fractal spacetime, with main contributions including:

1. **Fractal Generalization of Functional Renormalization Group Equations**: Established spectral dimension-dependent Wetterich equation, extending renormalization group theory to fractal spacetime background
2. **Spectral Dimension-Dependent Cutoff Function Theory**: Defined optimized cutoff functions and proved they satisfy dual conditions of UV completeness and IR safety
3. **Fixed Point Existence Theorem**: Rigorously proved existence and uniqueness of non-Gaussian fixed points, providing mathematical foundation for asymptotically safe gravity
4. **Geometric Interpretation of Renormalization Group Flow**: Revealed profound correspondence between renormalization group flow and spectral dimension flow

**Future Research Directions**:
- Explore rigorous mathematical theory of higher-order cutoff schemes
- Study non-perturbative effects in fractal spacetime
- Establish mathematical connection between renormalization group theory and holographic principle
