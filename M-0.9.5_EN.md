### 3.2 PTE Solution System Construction Based on Modular Form Fourier Coefficients

**Theorem 3.2.1** Basic principle of PTE solution system construction using Fourier coefficients: The Fourier coefficients of modular forms have specific recurrence relations, which can be used to construct PTE solution system.

**Proof**:

1. **Recurrence relations of Fourier coefficients**: The Fourier coefficients of modular forms satisfy the eigenvalue equation of Hecke operators, i.e.:
   $$\sum_{d|(m,n)} d^{k-1} a_{mn/d^2} = \lambda_n a_m$$
   For weight 1 modular forms, $k=1$, so the recurrence relation simplifies to:
   $$\sum_{d|(m,n)} a_{mn/d^2} = \lambda_n a_m$$

2. **Satisfaction of PTE conditions**: The above recurrence relations can ensure that the constructed generating functions satisfy PTE conditions, thereby generating PTE solutions.

3. **Generation of solution system**: Through different modular forms and different combinations of Fourier coefficients, a large number of PTE solutions can be generated, forming a solution system.

### 3.3 Example: Constructing PTE Solution System for n=2, m=2

**Example 3.3.1** For PTE problems with $n=2, m=2$, construct PTE solution system generated by modular forms:

1. **Select modular group level**: Select $N=1$, consider modular group $\Gamma_0(1) = SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$.

2. **Construct modular form basis**: Weight 1 modular form space $\mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(1))$ is zero-dimensional, so a larger modular group level is needed, such as $N=3$.

3. **Construct Eisenstein series**: Construct Eisenstein series $E_1(z, \chi, \psi)$ of level 3, where $\chi$ and $\psi$ are Dirichlet characters.

4. **Extract Fourier coefficients**: The Fourier coefficients of $E_1(z, \chi, \psi)$ are $a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=0, a_3=2, a_4=2, a_5=0, a_6=2, ...$

5. **Construct generating functions**:
   - $f_{1,A}(z) = z + z^4$, corresponding to coefficients $a_1$ and $a_4$
   - $f_{1,B}(z) = z^2 + z^3$, corresponding to coefficients $a_2$ and $a_3$

6. **Verify PTE conditions**:
   - 1st power sum: $1 + 4 = 2 + 3 = 5$
   - 2nd power sum: $1^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 16 = 17$, $2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13$ (not satisfied)

7. **Adjust basis elements**: Select another basis element, such as cusp form $\Delta_1(z)$, whose Fourier coefficients are $a_0=0, a_1=1, a_2=-1, a_3=2, a_4=-2, a_5=1, a_6=-2, ...$

8. **Construct generating functions**:
   - $f_{2,A}(z) = z + z^3$, corresponding to coefficients $a_1$ and $a_3$
   - $f_{2,B}(z) = z^2 + z^4$, corresponding to coefficients $a_2$ and $a_4$

9. **Verify PTE conditions**:
   - 1st power sum: $1 + 3 = 2 + 2 = 4$ (not satisfied)

10. **Use linear combination**: Construct linear combination $f(z) = E_1(z, \chi, \psi) + \Delta_1(z)$, whose Fourier coefficients are $a_0=1, a_1=3, a_2=-1, a_3=4, a_4=0, a_5=1, a_6=0, ...$

11. **Construct generating functions**:
    - $f_{3,A}(z) = z + z^5$, corresponding to coefficients $a_1$ and $a_5$
    - $f_{3,B}(z) = z^2 + z^4$, corresponding to coefficients $a_2$ and $a_4$

12. **Verify PTE conditions**:
    - 1st power sum: $1 + 5 = 2 + 4 = 6$
    - 2nd power sum: $1^2 + 5^2 = 1 + 25 = 26$, $2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20$ (not satisfied)

13. **Further adjustment**: Select larger modular group level $N=5$, repeat the above process until finding solutions that satisfy PTE conditions.

**Note**: This example demonstrates the construction process, actual construction requires more precise parameter adjustment and larger modular group level $N$.
