## Abstract

Based on the inner product space and orthogonal combination representation theory in the "Fixed 4D Topology-Dynamic Spectral Dimension Multiple Twisting Fractal Clifford Algebra Unified Field Theory" series papers, this paper designs an experimental scheme based on dual atomic clock differential measurement to verify the proximity relationship between the natural constant e and π-δ (δ=0.42331082513074800310235). This scheme transforms e and π-δ into linear combinations of orthogonal bases in inner product space, and utilizes the high-precision frequency stability of atomic clocks to convert abstract mathematical differences into measurable physical frequency signals. The experimental design uses cesium atomic clocks and optical lattice clocks as orthogonal basis carriers, and optimizes combination coefficients through the L-BFGS-B algorithm to achieve precise mapping from mathematical differences to physical signals. Feasibility analysis shows that this scheme is technically feasible, with expected measurement accuracy reaching the order of the theoretical difference (about 6×10⁻²³), which can provide direct experimental verification for theoretical predictions.

## 1. Introduction

The proximity relationship between the natural constant e and π-δ (δ=0.42331082513074800310235) is an important discovery in the "Fixed 4D Topology-Dynamic Spectral Dimension Multiple Twisting Fractal Clifford Algebra Unified Field Theory" [1][2]. Theoretical calculations show that the difference between them is approximately 6×10⁻²³, and this relationship originates from the orthogonal basis least square property in fractal Clifford algebra [3]. However, to date, this relationship has only been verified at the mathematical level, lacking direct experimental evidence.

Traditional verification methods for mathematical constants mainly rely on theoretical calculations, which are difficult to directly test through experiments. Based on the inner product space and orthogonal combination representation theory proposed in M-0.2 [4], this paper designs a novel experimental scheme to transform abstract mathematical differences into measurable physical frequency signals, providing direct experimental verification for the proximity relationship between e and π-δ.

This paper first introduces the theoretical foundation of the experimental scheme, including unified fractal dimension expression and inner product space orthogonal combination representation theory; then elaborates on the experimental design, including core principles, experimental architecture, and atomic clock selection;接着 analyzes key technologies in the experiment, such as orthogonal combination frequency synthesis, differential measurement and noise suppression, error suppression and long-term stability, and data inversion and result verification; finally conducts feasibility analysis to evaluate technical feasibility, accuracy, and expected results, and proposes potential challenges and solutions.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

According to the M-0.3 paper, the unified fractal dimension expression has the form [3]:

$$\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

where:
- $\{e_1, e_2\}$ are orthogonal fractal dimension bases, satisfying $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
- $q_0$ is the rational number basis, satisfying $\langle e_i, q_0 \rangle = 0$
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are rational coefficients

This expression is complete, all irrational numbers can be expressed in this form, and it has uniqueness and optimality.

### 2.2 Inner Product Space and Orthogonal Combination Representation

The M-0.2 paper proposes inner product space and orthogonal combination representation theory, which constructs orthogonal bases in fractal space to express any irrational number as a linear combination of orthogonal bases [4]:

$$\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot \vec{u}_i$$

where:
- $\{\vec{u}_i\}$ are orthogonal bases in fractal space
- $a_i$ are rational coefficients, optimized through the L-BFGS-B algorithm to minimize combination error

The core advantage of this theory is that through parameter optimization, the irrational number representation error can be reduced from 13.74% and 1.96% in traditional methods to 0.000000% [4].

### 2.3 Mathematical Essence of the Proximity Relationship between e and π-δ

According to M-0.3.1 and M-0.3.2 papers, the proximity relationship between e and π-δ originates from the orthogonal basis least square property in fractal Clifford algebra [1][2]. In fractal space, e and π-δ can be expressed as almost identical orthogonal basis combinations, with only minor differences in coefficients, resulting in a difference of approximately 6×10⁻²³ between them.

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 Core Principle: Frequency Mapping of Orthogonal Combination

The core principle of the experiment is to map orthogonal basis combinations in inner product space to energy level transition frequencies of atomic clocks. Specifically:

1. In inner product space, e and π-δ can be expressed as linear combinations of orthogonal bases:
   
   $$e = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot \vec{u}_i, \quad \pi-\delta = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i \cdot \vec{u}_i$$

2. The basis vectors $\{\vec{u}_i\}$ correspond to hyperfine energy levels of different atoms, with transition frequencies $\{f_i\}$

3. The coefficients $\{a_i, b_i\}$ are optimized through the L-BFGS-B algorithm to minimize combination error

4. Construct a synthesized frequency $f_{\text{syn}} = \sum_{i=1}^n (a_i - b_i) \cdot f_i$, which theoretically equals $|e - (\pi-\delta)| \cdot f_{\text{ref}}$ ($f_{\text{ref}}$ is the reference frequency)

5. Verify the proximity relationship between e and π-δ by measuring the deviation between the synthesized frequency and the theoretical value
