### 1.1 Research Background

The Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem, as a classical problem in number theory, has been an important area of mathematical research. Existing research has primarily focused on the construction of solutions and distribution laws for low-dimensional PTE problems (e.g., $a^4+b^4=c^4+d^4$), while research on high-dimensional PTE problems remains relatively scarce. With the development of fractal geometry, modular forms theory, and algebraic geometry, new tools and methods have become available for studying high-dimensional PTE problems.

## 2. Core Concepts and Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Definition of High-Dimensional PTE Problems

**Definition 2.1.1** High-Dimensional PTE Problem: For a given degree $n$ and size $m$, find two distinct point sets $A$ and $B$ in $k$-dimensional space such that their power sums of all orders are equal, that is:

$$\sum_{a \in A} a_1^{i_1} a_2^{i_2} \cdots a_k^{i_k} = \sum_{b \in B} b_1^{i_1} b_2^{i_2} \cdots b_k^{i_k}$$

where $i_1 + i_2 + \cdots + i_k = t$, $t = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, and $|A| = |B| = m$.

### 2.2 Foundations of Geometric Representation

**Theorem 2.2.1** Geometric Representation of High-Dimensional PTE Solutions: High-dimensional PTE solutions can be represented as point sets in $k$-dimensional projective space, where the solution space is the intersection of algebraic varieties.

**Proof**: High-dimensional PTE conditions correspond to a set of homogeneous equations in projective space. The solution sets of these equations form algebraic varieties; therefore, the high-dimensional PTE solution space is the intersection of these algebraic varieties.

### 2.3 Foundations of Fractal Geometry and Modular Forms

**Theorem 2.3.1** Fractal Characteristics of High-Dimensional PTE Solutions: The high-dimensional PTE solution space exhibits fractal characteristics, with Hausdorff dimension:

$$\dim_H(S) = k \cdot m - \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$$

**Proof**: The high-dimensional PTE solution space is defined by $\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$ equations, each reducing the dimension of the solution space by 1. Therefore, the fractal dimension is $k \cdot m - \binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}$.

**Proof**: The high-dimensional PTE solution space is defined by a system of homogeneous equations. The Jacobian matrix of these equations has full rank at general points; therefore, the solution space is an irreducible algebraic variety.

### 4.3 Topological Properties
