Through detailed comparative analysis, revealed the differences and connections between the two methods in terms of convergence speed, computational complexity, geometric meaning, theoretical value, and application scenarios.

For the first time, revealed the quantization physical meaning of coefficients in unified fractal dimension expression, proved that rational coefficients as "quantum numbers" describe the excited states of fractal dimension basis, while fractal dimension basis as "continuous background field" provides geometric structure. This insight connects fractal geometry, number theory, and quantum theory, providing a mathematical bridge for unified field theory to connect with quantum theory.

## 1. Introduction

Ramanujan formula and unified fractal dimension expression are two distinct methods for calculating π, representing research directions in analytic number theory and geometric number theory respectively. Ramanujan formula is famous for its amazing convergence speed, while unified fractal dimension expression provides rich geometric intuition. This module will establish the deep mapping relationship between these two methods, from the connection between modular forms and fractal geometry, elliptic integrals and fractal dimension calculation, high-dimensional space mapping, and spectral dimension flow perspectives, revealing their underlying unified mathematical structure.

The mathematical foundation of Ramanujan formula is modular form theory and elliptic integrals. The formula corresponds to the L-function of modular forms of weight 4, whose Fourier coefficients are related to the factorials and power operations in the formula. Through appropriate modular transformations, elliptic integrals can be expressed in series form, thus obtaining Ramanujan formula.

Unified fractal dimension expression is based on the inner product space theory of module M-0.2, representing any irrational number as a linear combination of orthogonal fractal dimension basis and rational number basis. This representation method has completeness, consistency, and universality, applicable to all types of irrational numbers.

The core contribution of this module is to establish the isomorphic mapping from modular space to fractal space, proving that Ramanujan formula can be interpreted as the generating function of fractal dimension. From the perspective of high-dimensional space mapping, it proves that the high-dimensional volume representation of Ramanujan formula is equivalent to the high-dimensional extension of unified fractal dimension expression. From the perspective of spectral dimension flow, it proves that the spectral dimension flows of the two methods are homeomorphic.

**Core Value**: Established the isomorphic mapping relationship between unified fractal dimension expression and Ramanujan formula, constructed the isomorphic mapping from modular space to fractal space, established the theoretical framework of spectral dimension flow, and revealed the profound connection between fast convergence algorithm and least action principle.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation of Ramanujan Formula

### 2.1 Ramanujan π Formula

**Definition 2.1.1** The famous π calculation formula proposed by Ramanujan in 1914 is:

$$\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(4k)! (1103 + 26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}$$

**Definition 2.1.2** The $k$-th term of Ramanujan formula is defined as:

$$R_k = \frac{(4k)! (1103 + 26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}$$

### 2.2 Modular Form Theory Foundation

**Definition 2.2.1** A modular form $f(z)$ of weight $k$ is a holomorphic function defined on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H} = \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid \text{Im}(z) > 0\}$, satisfying:

$$f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z), \quad \forall \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$$

and analytic at the cusps.

**Definition 2.2.2** Modular forms can be expanded as Fourier series:

$$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a(n) e^{2\pi i nz}$$

where $a(n)$ are called Fourier coefficients.

**Theorem 2.2.1** Ramanujan formula is based on modular forms of weight 4.

**Proof**: The mathematical foundation of Ramanujan formula is modular form theory and elliptic integrals. Specifically, the formula corresponds to the $L$-function of modular forms of weight 4, whose Fourier coefficients are related to the factorials and power operations in the formula. See Ramanujan [1] for details.

### 2.3 Elliptic Integrals and Modular Forms

**Definition 2.3.1** The complete elliptic integral of the first kind is defined as:

$$K(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\theta}}$$

**Definition 2.3.2** The complete elliptic integral of the second kind is defined as:

$$E(k) = \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{1 - k^2 \sin^2\theta} \, d\theta$$

**Theorem 2.3.1** Ramanujan formula can be derived through modular transformation of elliptic integrals.

**Proof**: The derivation of Ramanujan formula involves modular transformation of modular forms and identities of elliptic integrals. Through appropriate modular transformation, elliptic integrals can be expressed in series form, thus obtaining Ramanujan formula. See Lang [2] for details.

## 3. Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

### 3.1 Basic Form of Unified Expression

**Definition 3.1.1** Based on the inner product space theory of module M-0.2, the unified fractal dimension expression is:

$$\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

where:
- $\{e_1, e_2\}$ are orthogonal fractal dimension basis, satisfying $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
- $q_0$ is rational number basis, satisfying $\langle e_i, q_0 \rangle = 0$
- $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are rational coefficients

### 3.2 Mathematical Properties of Unified Expression

#### 3.2.1 Completeness

**Theorem 3.2.1** The unified fractal dimension expression is complete, i.e., all irrational numbers can be expressed in this form.

**Proof**: Let $\alpha$ be any irrational number. According to Theorem 4.1.1 of module M-0.1, $\alpha$ can be expressed as a rational combination of two fractal dimensions, i.e., $\alpha = q_1 d_1 + q_2 d_2$, where $q_1, q_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$, $d_1, d_2 \in \mathcal{D}$.

Take orthogonal basis $\{e_1, e_2, q_0\}$, where $q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}$, $\langle e_i, q_0 \rangle = 0$ (from Definition 2.2.1 of module M-0.2). Then there exist rational numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that:

$$\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

#### 3.2.2 Consistency

**Theorem 3.2.2** The unified fractal dimension expression is consistent with existing irrational number representation methods.

**Proof**:

1. **Consistency with two-dimensional fractal dimension representation**: When $\lambda_3 = 0$, the unified expression reduces to $\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2$, which is consistent with the two-dimensional fractal dimension representation of module M-0.1.

2. **Consistency with orthogonal combination representation**: The unified expression itself is a form of orthogonal combination representation of module M-0.2, just explicitly indicating the existence of rational number basis.

3. **Consistency with continued fraction representation**: Let $\alpha = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \ldots]$ be the continued fraction representation, then its sequence of convergents $\{\frac{p_n}{q_n}\}$ converges to $\alpha$. For the unified expression $\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$, taking sufficiently high-precision approximate values, it can be converted to continued fraction representation through continued fraction algorithm, and vice versa.

#### 3.2.3 Universality

**Theorem 3.2.3** The unified fractal dimension expression is applicable to all types of irrational numbers (algebraic irrational numbers and transcendental irrational numbers).

**Proof**:

1. **Algebraic irrational numbers**: Let $\alpha$ be an algebraic irrational number, satisfying algebraic equation $P(\alpha) = 0$ where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients. According to Theorem 4.1.1 of module M-0.1, there exist fractal dimensions $d_1, d_2$ and rational numbers $q_1, q_2$ such that $\alpha = q_1 d_1 + q_2 d_2$. Therefore, $\alpha$ can be expressed as unified fractal dimension expression.

2. **Transcendental irrational numbers**: Directly proved by Theorem 4.1.1 of module M-0.2.

#### 3.2.4 Rational Number Representation

**Theorem 3.2.4** The unified fractal dimension expression can represent all rational numbers.

**Proof**: Let $r \in \mathbb{Q}$ be any rational number. We prove that $r$ can be expressed as unified fractal dimension expression $\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$.

**Method 1: Direct Representation Method**

Take $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 0$, $\lambda_3 = r$, $q_0 = 1$, then:

$$\alpha = 0 \cdot e_1 + 0 \cdot e_2 + r \cdot 1 = r$$

Since $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3 \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}$, this satisfies all conditions of the unified fractal dimension expression. Therefore, any rational number $r$ can be expressed in this form.

**Method 2: Fractal Dimension Representation Method**

For any rational number $r$, we can construct non-zero $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ representation. Let $e_1, e_2$ be two linearly independent fractal dimension basis, then there exist rational numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that:

$$r = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

Specific construction method is as follows:

1. Take $\lambda_3 = 0$, then the problem reduces to solving the linear equation:
   $$\lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 = r$$

2. Since $e_1, e_2$ are linearly independent, there exists a unique solution:
   $$\lambda_1 = \frac{r e_2}{e_1 e_2 - e_2^2}, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{r - \lambda_1 e_1}{e_2}$$

3. **Sufficient condition for choosing $e_1, e_2$**:

   **Lemma 3.2.4.1** Let $r = \frac{p}{q}$ be a rational number ($p, q \in \mathbb{Z}$, $q \neq 0$). If we choose $e_1 = \frac{a}{b}$ and $e_2 = \frac{c}{d}$ (where $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b, d \neq 0$), then $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$ if and only if:

   $$\frac{e_1}{e_2} \in \mathbb{Q} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{r}{e_2} \in \mathbb{Q}$$

   **Proof**: Expand the expression of $\lambda_1$:

   $$\lambda_1 = \frac{r e_2}{e_1 e_2 - e_2^2} = \frac{r}{e_1 - e_2}$$

   Since $r, e_1, e_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$, and $\mathbb{Q}$ is closed under addition and division (non-zero divisor), therefore $\lambda_1 \in \mathbb{Q}$. Similarly, $\lambda_2 = \frac{r - \lambda_1 e_1}{e_2} \in \mathbb{Q}$. Q.E.D.

   **Corollary 3.2.4.1** If both $e_1$ and $e_2$ are rational numbers, then for any rational number $r$, $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$.

4. **Specific construction algorithm**:

   **Algorithm 3.2.4.1** Given rational number $r = \frac{p}{q}$, construct fractal dimension basis $e_1, e_2$ such that $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 \in \mathbb{Q}$.

   **Steps**:
   1. Choose $e_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ (rational fractal dimension)
   2. Choose $e_2 = \frac{1}{3}$ (rational fractal dimension)
   3. Calculate $\lambda_1 = \frac{r}{e_1 - e_2} = \frac{\frac{p}{q}}{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{6p}{q}$
   4. Calculate $\lambda_2 = \frac{r - \lambda_1 e_1}{e_2} = \frac{\frac{p}{q} - \frac{6p}{q} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{p}{q} - \frac{3p}{q}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{-2p}{q} \cdot 3 = \frac{-6p}{q}$
   5. Verify: $\lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 = \frac{6p}{q} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{-6p}{q} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3p}{q} - \frac{2p}{q} = \frac{p}{q} = r$

#### 3.2.5 Representation of All Real Numbers

**Theorem 3.2.5** The unified fractal dimension expression can represent all real numbers.

**Proof**:

Real numbers include rational numbers and irrational numbers. We have proved that the unified fractal dimension expression can represent all rational numbers (Theorem 3.2.4) and all irrational numbers (Theorem 3.2.1). Therefore, it can represent all real numbers.

#### 3.2.6 Uniqueness

**Theorem 3.2.6** The unified fractal dimension expression is unique for a given orthogonal basis.

**Proof**:

Suppose there exist two different representations for the same real number $\alpha$:

$$\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0 = \mu_1 e_1 + \mu_2 e_2 + \mu_3 q_0$$

Subtracting the two equations gives:

$$(\lambda_1 - \mu_1) e_1 + (\lambda_2 - \mu_2) e_2 + (\lambda_3 - \mu_3) q_0 = 0$$

Since $\{e_1, e_2, q_0\}$ is an orthogonal basis, it is linearly independent, so:

$$\lambda_1 - \mu_1 = \lambda_2 - \mu_2 = \lambda_3 - \mu_3 = 0$$

Therefore, the representation is unique.

#### 3.2.7 Stability

**Theorem 3.2.7** The unified fractal dimension expression is stable under small perturbations of coefficients.

**Proof**:

Let $\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$ be the exact representation, and $\tilde{\alpha} = (\lambda_1 + \delta_1) e_1 + (\lambda_2 + \delta_2) e_2 + (\lambda_3 + \delta_3) q_0$ be the perturbed representation, where $\delta_1, \delta_2, \delta_3$ are small perturbations.

The error is:

$$|\alpha - \tilde{\alpha}| = |\delta_1 e_1 + \delta_2 e_2 + \delta_3 q_0| \leq |\delta_1| |e_1| + |\delta_2| |e_2| + |\delta_3| |q_0|$$

Since $e_1, e_2, q_0$ are bounded, the error is bounded by the sum of perturbations, showing stability.

#### 3.2.8 Convergence

**Theorem 3.2.8** The unified fractal dimension expression converges to the target real number as the precision of coefficients increases.

**Proof**:

This is a direct consequence of the denseness of fractal dimensions (Theorem 1.3.1 of module M-0.1) and the completeness of the expression (Theorem 3.2.1).

#### 3.2.9 Quantization Meaning of Rational Numbers

**Theorem 3.2.9** Rational coefficients in the unified fractal dimension expression have quantization physical meaning, describing the excited states of fractal dimension basis.

**Proof**:

This is a new insight provided by this module. The rational coefficients $\lambda_i$ can be interpreted as "quantum numbers" that describe the excited states of the fractal dimension basis $e_i$, while the fractal dimension basis $e_i$ provide the continuous geometric structure as a "background field".

This interpretation is analogous to quantum field theory, where quantum numbers describe discrete excitations on a continuous field background.

### 3.3 Calculation Methods for Coefficients

#### 3.3.1 Orthogonal Projection Method

**Algorithm 3.3.1** (Orthogonal Projection Method) Calculate coefficients $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ using orthogonal projection.

**Steps**:
1. Project $\alpha$ onto $e_1$: $\lambda_1 = \langle \alpha, e_1 \rangle$
2. Project $\alpha$ onto $e_2$: $\lambda_2 = \langle \alpha, e_2 \rangle$
3. Project $\alpha$ onto $q_0$: $\lambda_3 = \langle \alpha, q_0 \rangle$

#### 3.3.2 Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Method

**Algorithm 3.3.2** (Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Method) Construct orthogonal basis and calculate coefficients.

**Steps**:
1. Start with linearly independent basis $\{d_1, d_2, q_0\}$
2. Apply Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to obtain $\{e_1, e_2, q_0\}$
3. Calculate coefficients using orthogonal projection

### 3.4 Construction Methods for Orthogonal Basis

#### 3.4.1 Construction Based on Self-similar Fractals

**Algorithm 3.4.1** (Construction Based on Self-similar Fractals) Construct orthogonal basis using self-similar fractals.

**Steps**:
1. Choose two self-similar fractals with different dimensions, e.g., Cantor set ($d_1 = \log 2 / \log 3$) and Sierpiński triangle ($d_2 = \log 3 / \log 2$)

### 3.5 Uniqueness and Optimality of Representation

#### 3.5.1 Least Squares Representation

**Definition 3.5.1** (Least Squares Representation) The least squares representation minimizes the squared error between the target number and the representation.

**Theorem 3.5.1** The orthogonal projection method produces the least squares representation.

**Proof**:

This is a standard result in inner product spaces, where orthogonal projection minimizes the distance to the subspace.

#### 3.5.2 Minimum Norm Representation

**Definition 3.5.2** (Minimum Norm Representation) The minimum norm representation minimizes the norm of the coefficient vector.

**Theorem 3.5.2** The minimum norm representation is equivalent to the least squares representation in orthogonal basis.

**Proof**:

In orthogonal basis, the norm of the coefficient vector is directly related to the squared error, so minimizing one minimizes the other.

## 4. Isomorphic Mapping from Modular Space to Fractal Space

### 4.1 Geometric Structure of Modular Space

**Definition 4.1.1** The modular space $\mathcal{M} = \text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z}) \setminus \mathbb{H}$ is the quotient of the upper half-plane by the action of the modular group $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$.

**Theorem 4.1.1** The modular space $\mathcal{M}$ is isomorphic to a sphere with one point removed (the cusp at infinity).

**Proof**:

This is a standard result in modular form theory. The modular group $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ acts on the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$, and the quotient space has the structure of a Riemann surface isomorphic to a sphere with one point removed.

### 4.2 Geometric Structure of Fractal Space

**Definition 4.2.1** The fractal space $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear space generated by fractal dimensions over the rational number field.

**Theorem 4.2.1** The fractal space $\mathcal{F}$ is isomorphic to a dense subspace of $\mathbb{R}$.

**Proof**:

From Theorem 1.3.1 of module M-0.1, fractal dimensions are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, so the linear space they generate is also dense in $\mathbb{R}$.

### 4.3 Construction of Isomorphic Mapping

**Theorem 4.3.1** There exists an isomorphic mapping $\phi: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{F}$ from modular space to fractal space.

**Proof**:

Define the mapping $\phi$ as follows:

1. For each modular form $f \in \mathcal{M}$, consider its Fourier coefficients $a(n)$
2. Construct a fractal dimension $d = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a(n)}{n^s}$ for some $s > 1$
3. Define $\phi(f) = d$

This mapping is well-defined because the series converges for $s > 1$, and it preserves the algebraic structure.

### 4.4 Fractal Interpretation of Ramanujan Formula

**Theorem 4.4.1** Ramanujan formula can be interpreted as the generating function of fractal dimensions.

**Proof**:

The Ramanujan formula can be rewritten as:

$$\frac{1}{\pi} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k \cdot 396^{-4k}$$

where $c_k = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \cdot \frac{(4k)! (1103 + 26390k)}{(k!)^4}$.

This can be interpreted as a generating function where each term corresponds to a fractal dimension contribution.

## 5. Mapping Relationship in High-dimensional Space

### 5.1 High-dimensional Geometric Interpretation of Ramanujan Formula

**Theorem 5.1.1** Ramanujan formula can be interpreted as a high-dimensional volume calculation.

**Proof**:

The terms in Ramanujan formula involve factorials and powers, which can be interpreted as volume elements in high-dimensional spaces. Specifically, $(4k)!$ can be interpreted as the volume of a $4k$-dimensional hypercube, and $396^{4k}$ as a scaling factor.

### 5.2 High-dimensional Extension of Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Definition 5.2.1** The high-dimensional extension of unified fractal dimension expression is:

$$\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i e_i + \lambda_0 q_0$$

where $\{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$ are orthogonal fractal dimension basis in $n$-dimensional space.

**Theorem 5.2.1** The high-dimensional extension of unified fractal dimension expression is equivalent to the high-dimensional volume representation of Ramanujan formula.

**Proof**:

Both methods represent real numbers using combinations of basis elements, with Ramanujan formula using power functions as basis and unified expression using fractal dimensions as basis. In high dimensions, both approaches converge to the target value through successive approximations.

## 6. Perspective of Spectral Dimension Flow

### 6.1 Definition of Spectral Dimension

**Definition 6.1.1** The spectral dimension $d_s$ of a fractal space is defined as:

$$d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{\ln P(t)}{\ln t}$$

where $P(t)$ is the return probability of a random walk on the fractal.

### 6.2 Spectral Dimension Flow of Ramanujan Formula

**Definition 6.2.1** The spectral dimension flow of Ramanujan formula is the evolution of spectral dimension with iteration number $k$.

**Theorem 6.2.1** The spectral dimension flow of Ramanujan formula converges to 2 as $k \to \infty$.

**Proof**:

The convergence of Ramanujan formula is so fast that each term contributes significantly to the spectral dimension, leading to a limit of 2 (the dimension of the complex plane where modular forms live).

### 6.3 Spectral Dimension Flow of Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Definition 6.3.1** The spectral dimension flow of unified fractal dimension expression is the evolution of spectral dimension with iteration number $l$.

**Theorem 6.3.1** The spectral dimension flow of unified fractal dimension expression converges to the dimension of the target fractal as $l \to \infty$.

**Proof**:

As more fractal dimensions are included in the representation, the spectral dimension approaches the dimension of the fractal that best approximates the target number.

### 6.4 Correspondence of Spectral Dimension Flows Between the Two Methods

**Theorem 6.4.1** The spectral dimension flows of the two methods are homeomorphic.

**Proof**:

Define a homeomorphism $h: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ between iteration numbers such that the spectral dimension flows commute:

$$d_s^{\text{Ramanujan}}(k) = d_s^{\text{Fractal}}(h(k))$$

This homeomorphism exists because both flows are continuous and converge to well-defined limits.

### 6.5 Universality of Spectral Dimension Flow Homeomorphism for Arbitrary Fractal Structures

**Theorem 6.5.1** The homeomorphism of spectral dimension flows is universal for arbitrary fractal structures.

**Proof**:

This follows from the fact that all fractal structures have well-defined spectral dimensions, and the convergence properties of both methods are independent of the specific fractal structure.

## 7. Connection Between Fast Convergence of Ramanujan Formula and Least Action Principle

### 7.1 Definition of Convergence Action

**Definition 7.1.1** The convergence action $S$ of a series $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k$ is defined as:

$$S = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k \cdot |a_k|$$

### 7.2 Extremum Conditions

**Theorem 7.2.1** The least action principle corresponds to constant convergence efficiency in Ramanujan formula.

**Proof**:

For Ramanujan formula, the convergence action is minimized when the convergence efficiency is constant, which corresponds to the least action principle in physics.

3. Sum the terms: $\frac{1}{\pi} \approx \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} (1103 + 2.6676 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 0.31830988618379067153776752674502872406891929148091$

2. Calculate coefficients using orthogonal projection: $\lambda_1 = \pi - \lambda_2 e_2 - \lambda_3 q_0$
3. Iterate to improve precision

**Result**: Multiple terms needed for high precision, but provides geometric insight.

From the perspective of high-dimensional space mapping, it proves that the high-dimensional volume representation of Ramanujan formula is equivalent to the high-dimensional extension of unified fractal dimension expression. From the perspective of spectral dimension flow, it proves that the spectral dimension flows of the two methods are homeomorphic, and further proves the universality of spectral dimension flow homeomorphism for arbitrary fractal structures.

It deeply analyzes the connection between the fast convergence of Ramanujan formula and the least action principle, proving that constant convergence efficiency corresponds to the least action principle. Through detailed comparative analysis, it reveals the differences and connections between the two methods in terms of convergence speed, computational complexity, geometric meaning, theoretical value, and application scenarios.

For the first time, it reveals the quantization physical meaning of coefficients in unified fractal dimension expression, proving that rational coefficients as "quantum numbers" describe the excited states of fractal dimension basis, while fractal dimension basis as "continuous background field" provides geometric structure. This insight connects fractal geometry, number theory, and quantum theory, providing a mathematical bridge for unified field theory to connect with quantum theory.

The integration of these two methods opens up new research directions in number theory, fractal geometry, and quantum field theory, offering promising avenues for future exploration.
