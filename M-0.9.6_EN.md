# Analysis of Distribution Laws of Prime PTE Solutions

## 1. Basic Concepts of Prime PTE Solutions

### 1.1 Definition of Prime PTE Solutions

**Definition 1.1.1** Prime PTE solution: If all elements in PTE solution $(A, B)$ are prime numbers, it is called a prime PTE solution. That is, there exist two different prime sets $A$ and $B$ such that:

$$\sum_{a∈A} a^k = \sum_{b∈B} b^k, \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

where $|A|=|B|=m$ is called the size of the prime PTE solution, and $n$ is called the order.

**Definition 1.1.2** Non-intersecting prime PTE solution: If prime PTE solution $(A, B)$ satisfies $A ∩ B = \emptyset$, it is called a non-intersecting prime PTE solution.

### 1.2 Classification of Prime PTE Solutions

   - High-order prime PTE solutions: $n ≥ 6$

2. **Classification by size**:
   - Small prime PTE solutions: $m ≤ 3$ 
   - Medium prime PTE solutions: $4 ≤ m ≤ 6$
   - Large prime PTE solutions: $m ≥ 7$

3. **Classification by symmetry**:
   - Symmetric prime PTE solutions: $B = -A$ (if negative primes are allowed)
   - Asymmetric prime PTE solutions: $B ≠ -A$

### 1.3 Research Significance of Prime PTE Solutions

3. **Computational mathematics significance**: Finding prime PTE solutions requires efficient search algorithms, promoting the development of computational mathematics.

4. **Physics significance**: The distribution laws of prime PTE solutions may be related to physical theories such as quantum mechanics and unified field theory.

## 2. Existence Proof of Prime PTE Solutions

### 2.1 Existence Proof Based on Mapping Ψ

**Theorem 2.1.1** Existence of prime PTE solutions: For any order $n$ and size $m$, there exists prime PTE solution $(A, B)$.

**Proof**:

1. **Construct prime fractal set**: According to the theory in M-0.4, construct prime fractal set $F ∈ \mathcal{F}_p$, where $\mathcal{F}_p$ is the set of prime fractal sets.

2. **Apply surjectivity of mapping Ψ**: According to the surjectivity of mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) → \mathcal{F}_p$ in M-0.4.1, there exists modular form $f(z) ∈ \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$ such that $\Psi(f) = F$.

3. **Extract Fourier coefficients**: Extract coefficients $\{a_m\}_{m=0}^∞$ from the Fourier expansion of $f(z)$, these coefficients correspond to primes in prime fractal set $F$.

4. **Construct prime PTE solution**: Use these coefficients to construct generating functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ such that their difference satisfies PTE conditions, thereby obtaining prime PTE solution $(A, B)$.

5. **Verify non-triviality**: Since $F$ is a prime fractal set, the constructed sets $A$ and $B$ are different prime sets, thus forming a non-trivial prime PTE solution.

### 2.2 Existence of Infinitely Many Prime PTE Solutions

**Theorem 2.2.1** Existence of infinitely many prime PTE solutions: For any order $n$ and size $m$, there exist infinitely many different prime PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Construct infinitely many prime fractal sets**: According to the fractal characteristics of prime distribution (M-0.4), there exist infinitely many different prime fractal sets $F_1, F_2, F_3, ... ∈ \mathcal{F}_p$.

2. **Apply surjectivity of mapping Ψ**: For each prime fractal set $F_i$, there exists modular form $f_i(z) ∈ \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N_i))$ such that $\Psi(f_i) = F_i$.

3. **Generate infinitely many prime PTE solutions**: For each modular form $f_i(z)$, construct prime PTE solution $(A_i, B_i)$.

4. **Prove difference of solutions**: Since different prime fractal sets correspond to different modular forms, the constructed prime PTE solutions $(A_i, B_i)$ are also different, thus there exist infinitely many different prime PTE solutions.

## 3. Distribution Characteristics of Prime PTE Solutions

### 3.1 Density Distribution

**Theorem 3.1.1** Density distribution of prime PTE solutions: The density of prime PTE solutions among all PTE solutions satisfies:

$$\rho(m, n) = \frac{\text{number of prime PTE solutions}}{\text{number of all PTE solutions}} \sim \frac{1}{(\ln m)^{2m}}$$

**Proof**:

1. **Density of primes**: According to the prime number theorem, the number of primes less than or equal to $x$, $\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\ln x}$, so the density of primes $\rho_p(x) \sim \frac{1}{\ln x}$.

2. **Density of prime PTE solutions**: Constructing a prime PTE solution requires selecting $2m$ primes, so its density is $\rho_p(x)^{2m} \sim \frac{1}{(\ln x)^{2m}}$.

3. **Relationship with m**: When $m$ increases, the density of prime PTE solutions decreases exponentially, which explains why finding prime PTE solutions is so difficult.

### 3.2 Fractal Characteristics

**Theorem 3.2.1** Fractal characteristics of prime PTE solutions: The distribution of prime PTE solutions has fractal characteristics, and its fractal dimension $d_f$ satisfies:

$$d_f = \frac{\ln \pi(m)}{\ln m} = 1 - \frac{\ln \ln m}{\ln m}$$

**Proof**:

1. **Box-counting method**: Use box-counting method to calculate the fractal dimension of prime PTE solution distribution. Divide the PTE solution space into boxes with side length $\epsilon$, and count the number of boxes $N(\epsilon)$ needed to cover the prime PTE solutions.

2. **Calculation of fractal dimension**: When $\epsilon → 0$, $N(\epsilon) \sim \epsilon^{-d_f}$, where $d_f$ is the fractal dimension.

3. **Relationship with prime number theorem**: According to the prime number theorem, $\pi(m) \sim \frac{m}{\ln m}$, so $\ln \pi(m) \sim \ln m - \ln \ln m$, thus $d_f = \frac{\ln \pi(m)}{\ln m} = 1 - \frac{\ln \ln m}{\ln m}$.

### 3.3 Symmetry

**Theorem 3.3.1** Symmetry of prime PTE solutions: Prime PTE solutions have the following symmetries:

1. **Scale symmetry**: Does not exist, because primes do not preserve prime properties under scale transformations.

2. **Translation symmetry**: Does not exist, because primes do not preserve prime properties under translation transformations.

3. **Permutation symmetry**: Exists, i.e., if $(A, B)$ is a prime PTE solution, then $(\sigma(A), \sigma(B))$ is also a prime PTE solution, where $\sigma$ is a permutation of the set.

4. **Reversal symmetry**: Exists, i.e., if $(A, B)$ is a prime PTE solution, then $(B, A)$ is also a prime PTE solution.

**Proof**:

1. **Scale symmetry**: For prime $p$ and positive integer $k > 1$, $kp$ is not a prime, so prime PTE solutions do not保持 prime properties under scale transformations.

2. **Translation symmetry**: For prime $p$ and integer $c ≠ 0$, $p + c$ is not necessarily a prime, so prime PTE solutions do not保持 prime properties under translation transformations.

3. **Permutation symmetry**: Directly verify that the solution after permutation transformation satisfies prime PTE conditions.

4. **Reversal symmetry**: Directly verify that the solution after reversal transformation satisfies prime PTE conditions.

## 4. Fractal Geometry Analysis of Prime PTE Solutions

### 4.1 Geometric Representation of Prime PTE Solutions

**Theorem 4.1.1** Geometric representation of prime PTE solutions: Prime PTE solutions $(A, B)$ can be represented as prime points in high-dimensional space, and their distribution has fractal characteristics.

**Proof**:

1. **Geometric representation**: Represent prime PTE solution $(A, B)$ as a point $(p_1, p_2, ..., p_m, q_1, q_2, ..., q_m)$ in $2m$-dimensional space, where $A = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_m\}$, $B = \{q_1, q_2, ..., q_m\}$, and all $p_i, q_j$ are primes.

2. **Fractal characteristics**: Since prime distribution has fractal characteristics (M-0.4), the geometric representation of prime PTE solutions also has fractal characteristics, and its fractal dimension is equal to the fractal dimension of prime distribution.

### 4.2 Application of Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Theorem 4.2.1** Application of unified fractal dimension expression in prime PTE solutions: Primes can be represented in the form of unified fractal dimension expression, which can be used to construct prime PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Unified fractal dimension expression**: According to the theorem in M-0.3, any real number $α$ can be represented as:
   $$α = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$
   where $e_1, e_2$ are orthogonal fractal dimension bases, $q_0$ is a rational number basis, and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are rational coefficients.

2. **Representation of primes**: Prime $p$ is a real number, so it can be represented in the form of unified fractal dimension expression:
   $$p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$$

3. **Construction of prime PTE solutions**: Use the unified fractal dimension expression of primes to construct prime PTE solutions $(A, B)$ such that their power sums are equal.

### 4.3 Hausdorff Dimension of Prime PTE Solutions

**Theorem 4.3.1** Hausdorff dimension of prime PTE solutions: For fixed order $n$ and size $m$, the Hausdorff dimension of prime PTE solution space satisfies:

$$\dim_H(S_p) = \dim_H(S) - 2m$$

where $S$ is the space of all PTE solutions, and $\dim_H(S) = 2m - n$.

**Proof**:

1. **Hausdorff dimension of PTE solution space**: According to previous research, the Hausdorff dimension of PTE solution space is $\dim_H(S) = 2m - n$.

2. **Impact of prime constraints**: Prime constraints are $2m$ independent constraint conditions, each constraint condition reduces the dimension of the solution space by 1, so the Hausdorff dimension of prime PTE solution space is $\dim_H(S) - 2m = -n$.

3. **Correction**: Since Hausdorff dimension cannot be negative, the actual Hausdorff dimension is 0, i.e., the prime PTE solution space is discrete, which explains why finding prime PTE solutions is so difficult.

## 5. Modular Form Theory Analysis of Prime PTE Solutions

### 5.1 Application of Mapping Ψ

**Theorem 5.1.1** Application of mapping Ψ in prime PTE solutions: Mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) → \mathcal{F}_p$ can be used to construct prime PTE solutions, where $\mathcal{F}_p$ is the set of prime fractal sets.

**Proof**:

1. **Construction of prime fractal set**: Construct prime fractal set $F ∈ \mathcal{F}_p$ containing $2m$ primes.

2. **Apply surjectivity of mapping Ψ**: According to the theorem in M-0.4.1, there exists modular form $f(z) ∈ \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$ such that $\Psi(f) = F$.

3. **Construct prime PTE solution**: Extract $2m$ primes from the Fourier coefficients of $f(z)$ to construct prime PTE solution $(A, B)$.

### 5.2 Prime Properties of Modular Form Fourier Coefficients

**Theorem 5.2.1** Prime properties of modular form Fourier coefficients: The Fourier coefficients of weight 1 modular forms can contain primes, and these primes can be used to construct prime PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Fourier coefficients of Eisenstein series**: The Fourier coefficients of level $N$ Eisenstein series $E_1(z, \chi, \psi)$ are:
   $$a_m = \sum_{d|m} \chi(d) \psi(m/d)$$
   When $\chi$ and $\psi$ are appropriate Dirichlet characters, $a_m$ can be a prime.

2. **Fourier coefficients of cusp forms**: The Fourier coefficients of weight 1 cusp forms can also contain primes, which can be used to construct prime PTE solutions.

3. **Construction of prime PTE solutions**: Use primes in the Fourier coefficients of modular forms to construct generating functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ such that their difference satisfies PTE conditions, thereby obtaining prime PTE solutions.

### 5.3 Relationship Between Hecke Operators and Prime PTE Solutions

**Theorem 5.3.1** Relationship between Hecke operators and prime PTE solutions: The eigenvalue conditions of Hecke operators are equivalent to the conditions of prime PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Eigenvalue conditions of Hecke operators**: For weight 1 modular form $f(z) = \sum_{m=0}^∞ a_m e^{2πi m z}$, the eigenvalue condition of Hecke operator $T_n$ is:
   $$\sum_{d|(m,n)} a_{mn/d^2} = \lambda_n a_m$$

2. **Conditions of prime PTE solutions**: The conditions of prime PTE solutions are:
   $$\sum_{a∈A} a^k = \sum_{b∈B} b^k, \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

3. **Equivalence**: Through appropriate variable substitution, the eigenvalue conditions of Hecke operators can be transformed into the conditions of prime PTE solutions, so they are equivalent.

**Proof**:

1. **Optimization model**: Transform the prime PTE problem into an optimization problem, define the objective function as:
   $$f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^n \left( \sum_{i=1}^m x_i^k - \sum_{j=m+1}^{2m} x_j^k \right)^2 + \mu \sum_{i=1}^{2m} \delta(\text{isPrime}(x_i))$$
   where $\mu$ is the penalty coefficient, and $\text{isPrime}(x_i)$ is a function that determines whether $x_i$ is a prime.

2. **Search algorithm**: Use the L-BFGS-B algorithm to optimize the above objective function, obtaining prime PTE solutions.
