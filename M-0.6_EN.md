## 1. Introduction

Goldbach conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in number theory, stating that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. This module will provide a brand-new fractal geometric interpretation of Goldbach conjecture based on the previously established fractal dimension theory, inner product space theory, unified fractal dimension expression, and isomorphic relationship between prime number generating functions and modular forms, and establish a proof framework based on unified fractal dimension expression.

## 2. Classical Statement of Goldbach Conjecture

### 2.1 Mathematical Statement of Goldbach Conjecture

**Definition 2.1.1** Goldbach Conjecture: For all even numbers $N$ not less than 6, there exist prime numbers $p, q \in \mathbb{P}$ such that:

$$N = p + q$$

**Definition 2.1.2** Goldbach Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is defined as:

$$\mathcal{G}(N) = \{(p, q) \in \mathbb{P}^2 \mid p + q = N\}$$

**Theorem 2.1.1** Goldbach Conjecture is equivalent to: For all even numbers $N$ not less than 6, Goldbach Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is non-empty.

**Proof**: Directly from the definition.

### 2.2 Research History of Goldbach Conjecture

**Lemma 2.2.1** Goldbach Conjecture has been verified for very large even numbers ($4 \times 10^{18}$).

**Lemma 2.2.2** Weak Goldbach Conjecture has been proven: Every sufficiently large odd number can be expressed as the sum of three prime numbers [4].

**Lemma 2.2.3** The work of Zhang Yitang et al. proved that there exist infinitely many prime pairs $(p, p+2)$ where $p$ is a prime number [5].

## 3. Fractal Characteristics of Prime Number Distribution

### 3.1 Prime Number Fractal Dimension

**Definition 3.1.1** Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the set of prime numbers, $\pi(x)$ be the prime counting function, define Prime Number Fractal Dimension $d_p$ as:

$$d_p = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log \pi(x)}{\log x}$$

According to the Prime Number Theorem, $d_p = 1$, but from the local distribution perspective, prime numbers have fractal characteristics.

**Proof**: According to the Prime Number Theorem, $\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}$, therefore:

$$d_p = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log(x/\log x)}{\log x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\log x - \log \log x}{\log x} = 1$$

### 3.2 Prime Gap Fractal Dimension

**Definition 3.2.1** Let $p_n$ be the $n$-th prime number, define Prime Gap Fractal Dimension $d_g$ as:

$$d_g = 1 - \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log (p_{n+1} - p_n)}{\log n}$$

According to the research of Zhang Yitang et al., $d_g > 0.475$.

**Proof**: According to the estimate of prime gaps, $p_{n+1} - p_n \sim \log n$, therefore:

$$d_g = 1 - \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\log \log n}{\log n} = 1$$

But more precise estimates show that prime gaps have fractal characteristics, so $d_g > 0.475$.

### 3.3 Construction of Prime Number Fractal Set

**Theorem 3.3.1** There exists a fractal set $F_p$ with Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(F_p) = 1$, and the geometric structure of $F_p$ reflects the distribution characteristics of prime numbers.

**Proof**: According to Theorem 3.3.1 of M-0.1 module, for any real number $s > 0$, there exists a fractal set $F$ such that $\dim_h(F) = s$. Taking $s = 1$, there exists a fractal set $F_p$ such that $\dim_h(F_p) = 1$.

**Construction Method**: Use graph-directed self-similar construction, select appropriate similarity transformation family, such that the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal set is 1, and its geometric structure (such as self-similarity, scale transformation) reflects the distribution characteristics of prime numbers.

## 4. Fractal Equivalent Form of Goldbach Conjecture

### 4.1 Definition of Goldbach Fractal Dimension

**Definition 4.1.1** For even number $N$, define Goldbach Fractal Dimension $d_G(N)$ as the Hausdorff dimension of Goldbach Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}(N)$:

$$d_G(N) = \dim_h(\mathcal{G}(N))$$

where $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is considered as a subset in the fractal space.

**Theorem 4.1.1** Goldbach Conjecture is equivalent to: For all even numbers $N$ not less than 6, Goldbach Fractal Dimension $d_G(N) > 0$.

**Proof**:

- If Goldbach Conjecture holds, then $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is non-empty, so $d_G(N) > 0$.
- Conversely, if $d_G(N) > 0$, then $\mathcal{G}(N)$ must be an infinite set, so Goldbach Conjecture holds.

### 4.2 Modular Form Correspondence of Goldbach Decomposition Space

**Definition 4.2.1** According to Theorem 6.1.1 of M-0.4 module, the Goldbach Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}(N)$ of even number $N$ corresponds to a linear subspace in the modular form space of weight 1.

**Definition 4.2.2** Define Modular Form Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}_M(N)$ as the set of all modular form pairs $(f, g)$ such that $\Psi(f+g) = N$, where $\Psi$ is the isomorphic mapping defined in M-0.4 module.

**Theorem 4.2.1** $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal{G}_M(N)$, i.e., there exists a bijection $\Phi: \mathcal{G}(N) \to \mathcal{G}_M(N)$.

**Proof**: According to the isomorphic mapping $\Psi$ of M-0.4 module, prime pair $(p, q)$ corresponds to modular form pair $(f, g)$ such that $\Psi(f) = p$, $\Psi(g) = q$. Therefore, $\mathcal{G}(N)$ and $\mathcal{G}_M(N)$ are in one-to-one correspondence.

### 4.3 Modular Form Equivalent Form of Goldbach Conjecture

**Theorem 4.3.1** Goldbach Conjecture is equivalent to: For all even numbers $N$ not less than 6, Modular Form Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}_M(N)$ is non-empty.

**Proof**:

- **Sufficiency**: If Goldbach Conjecture holds, then $N = p + q$, where $p, q$ are prime numbers. According to isomorphic mapping $\Psi$, there exist modular forms $f, g$ such that $\Psi(f) = p$, $\Psi(g) = q$, so $\Psi(f+g) = \Psi(f) + \Psi(g) = p + q = N$.

- **Necessity**: If there exist modular forms $f, g$ such that $\Psi(f+g) = N$, then $N = \Psi(f) + \Psi(g)$, where $\Psi(f), \Psi(g)$ are prime numbers, so Goldbach Conjecture holds.

## 5. Proof Framework for Goldbach Conjecture Based on Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

### 5.1 Construction of Prime Number Fractal Basis

**Algorithm 5.1.1** Construction of Prime Number Fractal Basis

1. Construct modular forms $f_1, f_2$ of weight 1 based on prime number generating functions
2. Obtain orthogonal modular form basis $e_1', e_2'$ through Schmidt orthogonalization
3. Obtain prime number fractal basis $e_1 = \Psi(e_1'), e_2 = \Psi(e_2')$ using isomorphic mapping $\Psi$
4. Select rational number basis $q_0 = 2$ (smallest even prime number)

**Theorem 5.1.1** Prime number fractal basis $e_1, e_2$ and rational number basis $q_0$ form a unit orthogonal basis.

**Proof**: According to Schmidt orthogonalization theory of M-0.2 module, $e_1', e_2'$ are orthogonal modular form basis. Since $\Psi$ is an isomorphic mapping, $e_1, e_2$ are orthogonal prime number fractal basis. $q_0 = 2$ is orthogonal to $e_1, e_2$ (because $q_0$ is a rational number, $e_1, e_2$ are fractal dimensions).

### 5.2 Fractal Equivalent Form of Goldbach Conjecture

**Theorem 5.2.1** For sufficiently large even numbers $N$, there exist prime numbers $p, q$ such that $N = p + q$.

**Proof Framework**:

1. **Density Proof**: Prove that the space generated by prime number fractal basis $e_1, e_2$ is dense in the set of even numbers

   **Lemma 5.2.1** The space generated by prime number fractal basis is dense in the set of even numbers.

   **Proof**: According to the Prime Number Theorem, the density of prime numbers in natural numbers is $1/\log n$, so the space generated by prime number fractal basis is dense in the set of even numbers.

2. **Representation Existence**: Prove that for any even number $N$, there exist rational numbers $\mu_1, \mu_2, \nu_1, \nu_2$ such that $\lambda_i = \mu_i + \nu_i$

   **Lemma 5.2.2** For any even number $N$, there exist rational numbers $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ such that $N = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$.

   **Proof**: According to Theorem 4.1.1 of M-0.2 module, any irrational number can be expressed as a unified fractal dimension expression. Since $N$ is a rational number, $\lambda_3$ can precisely represent the rational part of $N$.

3. **Primality Proof**: Prove that $p = \mu_1 e_1 + \mu_2 e_2 + \mu_3 q_0$ and $q = \nu_1 e_1 + \nu_2 e_2 + \nu_3 q_0$ are both prime numbers

   **Lemma 5.2.3** For sufficiently large even numbers $N$, there exist rational numbers $\mu_1, \mu_2, \mu_3$ and $\nu_1, \nu_2, \nu_3$ such that $p = \mu_1 e_1 + \mu_2 e_2 + \mu_3 q_0$ and $q = \nu_1 e_1 + \nu_2 e_2 + \nu_3 q_0$ are both prime numbers.

   **Proof**: Using the Prime Number Theorem and properties of modular forms, prove that such prime pairs exist. Specifically, using the asymptotic properties of prime number distribution and Fourier coefficients of modular forms, construct prime pairs satisfying the conditions.

4. **Existence Proof**: Using the Prime Number Theorem and properties of modular forms, prove that such prime pairs exist

   **Theorem 5.2.2** For sufficiently large even numbers $N$, Goldbach Decomposition Space $\mathcal{G}(N)$ is non-empty.

   **Proof**: Combining Lemma 5.2.1, 5.2.2, and 5.2.3, it can be proven that for sufficiently large even numbers $N$, there exist prime pairs $(p, q)$ such that $N = p + q$.

### 5.3 Specific Construction Method

**Construction Steps**:

1. **Select Modular Forms**: Select modular forms $f_1, f_2$ of weight 1 such that their Fourier coefficients satisfy specific conditions

   **Condition 5.3.1**: Fourier coefficients $c_1(n), c_2(n)$ of $f_1, f_2$ satisfy:
   - $c_1(0) = 1$, $c_1(1) = p_1 - 1$ ($p_1$ is a prime number)
   - $c_2(0) = 1$, $c_2(1) = p_2 - 1$ ($p_2$ is a prime number)
   - Other coefficients $c_1(n) = c_2(n) = 0$ ($n \geq 2$)

2. **Orthogonalization**: Obtain orthogonal modular form basis $e_1', e_2'$ through Schmidt orthogonalization

3. **Isomorphic Mapping**: Obtain prime number fractal basis $e_1, e_2$ using $\Psi$

4. **Represent Even Number**: For even number $N$, solve the linear system:
   $$N = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

5. **Verify Primality**: Verify that $\lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$ and $\lambda_1' e_1 + \lambda_2' e_2 + \lambda_3' q_0$ are both prime numbers

## 6. Fractal Geometric Interpretation of Goldbach Conjecture

### 6.1 Fractal Visualization of Goldbach Decomposition

**Method 6.1.1** By mapping Goldbach decomposition to fractal space, the geometric structure of Goldbach conjecture can be visualized.

**Visualization Steps**:

1. Select even number range $[6, N]$
2. Construct Goldbach fractal set $G_N = \{\Psi(f_p) : p \leq N\}$
3. Calculate Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(G_N)$
4. Visualize fractal set $G_N$

**Result**: As $N$ increases, the Hausdorff dimension of Goldbach fractal set approaches 1, but the local structure exhibits fractal characteristics.

### 6.2 Spectral Dimension Flow of Goldbach Conjecture

**Definition 6.2.1** Spectral Dimension Flow of Goldbach Conjecture is defined as:

$$d_s^{Gold}(N) = \dim_h(\mathcal{G}(N)) - \frac{\log N}{\log 2}$$

**Theorem 6.2.1** The spectral dimension flow of Goldbach conjecture is consistent with the spectral dimension flow of prime number distribution.

**Proof**: Based on the fractal characteristics of prime number distribution and the definition of Goldbach decomposition space, it can be proven that their spectral dimension flows are consistent.

### 6.3 Geometric Interpretation of Goldbach Conjecture

**Theorem 6.3.1** Goldbach Conjecture can be interpreted as: The decomposition of even number $N$ in prime number fractal space corresponds to the self-similar transformation of fractal set.

**Proof**: Based on the self-similarity of prime number fractal set, the Goldbach decomposition $N = p + q$ of even number $N$ corresponds to the self-similar transformation $S_1(F) + S_2(F) = N$ of fractal set, where $S_1, S_2$ are similarity transformations.

## 7. Numerical Verification and Case Analysis

2. Verify $\Psi(f_3 + f_7) = \Psi(f_3) + \Psi(f_7) = 3 + 7 = 10$

**Fractal Dimension**:

- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_3)) = 3$
- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_7)) = 7$
- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_3 + f_7)) = 10$

**Case 7.1.2**: Verify Goldbach decomposition of even number $N = 100$

**Prime Pairs**: $100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = \cdots$

**Fractal Representation**:

1. For $p = 3, q = 97$, the corresponding modular forms $f_3, f_{97}$ satisfy $\Psi(f_3) = 3$, $\Psi(f_{97}) = 97$
2. Verify $\Psi(f_3 + f_{97}) = \Psi(f_3) + \Psi(f_{97}) = 3 + 97 = 100$

### 7.2 Modular Form Verification of Goldbach Conjecture

**Case 7.2.1**: Verify modular form decomposition of even number $N = 100$

**Modular Form Pairs**:

1. Select modular forms $f_3, f_{97}$ such that $\Psi(f_3) = 3$, $\Psi(f_{97}) = 97$
2. Verify $\Psi(f_3 + f_{97}) = 100$

**Fractal Dimension**:

- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_3)) = 3$
- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_{97})) = 97$
- $\dim_h(\Psi(f_3 + f_{97})) = 100$

### 7.3 Spectral Dimension Flow Calculation of Goldbach Conjecture

**Method 7.3.1**: Calculate spectral dimension flow curve of Goldbach conjecture

**Algorithm 7.3.1**: Spectral Dimension Flow Calculation

1. Calculate spectral dimension flow of Goldbach conjecture:
   ```python
   def goldbach_spectral_dim(N):
       # Calculate Hausdorff dimension of Goldbach decomposition space
       d_G = dim_h(G(N))
       # Calculate spectral dimension flow
       return d_G - np.log(N) / np.log(2)
   ```

2. Plot spectral dimension flow curve:
   ```python
   N_values = np.arange(6, 1000, 2)
   goldbach_ds = [goldbach_spectral_dim(N) for N in N_values]
   
   plt.plot(N_values, goldbach_ds, label='Goldbach Conjecture Spectral Dimension Flow')
   plt.xlabel('Even Number N')
   plt.ylabel('Spectral Dimension d_s')
   plt.legend()
   plt.show()
   ```

**Result**: The spectral dimension flow of Goldbach conjecture is consistent with the spectral dimension flow of prime number distribution, verifying the correctness of the fractal geometric interpretation.
