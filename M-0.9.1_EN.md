# Deep Connections between PTE Problem and Fractal Geometry

## 1. Basic Definition and Geometric Representation of PTE Problem

### 1.1 Strict Definition of PTE Problem

**Definition 1.1.1** The Prouhet-Tarry-Escott (PTE) problem refers to finding two distinct non-empty integer sets A and B such that their power sums are equal:

$$\sum_{a∈A} a^k = \sum_{b∈B} b^k, \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

where n is called the order of the PTE problem, and |A|=|B|=m is called the size of the PTE problem. If sets A and B are disjoint, the solution is called a disjoint solution.

**Definition 1.1.2** A solution to the PTE problem can be represented as an ordered pair (A, B), where A and B are integer sets satisfying the above conditions. All solutions satisfying the conditions form the PTE solution space.

### 1.2 Geometric Representation of PTE Solutions

**Theorem 1.2.1** Each PTE solution (A, B) can be represented as a point in 2m-dimensional space, where m is the set size.

**Proof**: Let A = {a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ}, B = {b₁, b₂, ..., bₘ}, then we can define the mapping φ: (A, B) → ℝ²ᵐ, where:

$$φ(A, B) = (a₁, a₂, ..., aₘ, b₁, b₂, ..., bₘ)$$

This mapping is injective because different set pairs correspond to different points.

**Theorem 1.2.2** The PTE solution space is an algebraic variety in ℝ²ᵐ, defined by n equations:

$$\sum_{i=1}^m a_i^k - \sum_{i=1}^m b_i^k = 0, \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

**Proof**: The PTE conditions directly give these equations, so the PTE solution space is the common solution set of these equations, i.e., an algebraic variety.

### 1.3 Fractal Characteristics of PTE Solutions

**Definition 1.3.1** Let S be the PTE solution space, its fractal dimension can be characterized by the Hausdorff dimension dim_H(S) or box dimension dim_B(S).

**Theorem 1.3.1** For fixed order n and size m, the Hausdorff dimension of the PTE solution space S satisfies:

$$dim_H(S) = 2m - n$$

**Proof**:

1. **Upper Bound Estimation**: The PTE solution space is defined by n equations, and according to theorems in algebraic geometry, its dimension does not exceed 2m - n.

2. **Lower Bound Estimation**: Consider the method of constructing PTE solutions. For a given set A, we can find set B by solving a system of linear equations such that their power sums are equal. The degree of freedom of this linear system is 2m - n, so the dimension of the solution space is at least 2m - n.

3. **Equality Holds**: When n < 2m, the PTE solution space is non-empty, and the above upper and lower bounds are equal, so dim_H(S) = 2m - n.

**Corollary 1.3.1** When n = 2m - 1, the PTE solution space is discrete, and its Hausdorff dimension is 0; when n < 2m - 1, the PTE solution space is continuous, and its Hausdorff dimension is a positive real number.

**Note**: This corollary explains why finding non-trivial PTE solutions (i.e., n = 2m - 1) is so difficult, because they are discrete and hard to construct through continuous methods.

## 2. Unified Fractal Dimension Expression and Construction of PTE Solutions

### 2.1 Review of Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Theorem 2.1.1** Unified fractal dimension expression (M-0.3): Any real number α can be expressed as:

$$α = λ₁ e₁ + λ₂ e₂ + λ₃ q₀$$

where:
- {e₁, e₂} are orthogonal fractal dimension bases, satisfying ⟨eᵢ, eⱼ⟩ = δᵢⱼ
- q₀ is a rational basis, satisfying ⟨eᵢ, q₀⟩ = 0
- λ₁, λ₂, λ₃ are rational coefficients

### 2.2 Fractal Dimension Representation of PTE Solutions

**Definition 2.2.1** Let A and B be solutions to the PTE problem, if their elements can be expressed by the unified fractal dimension expression, then (A, B) is called a fractal PTE solution.

**Theorem 2.2.1** There exist fractal PTE solutions, i.e., there exist sets A and B such that:

1. For all a ∈ A, there exist rational numbers λ₁(a), λ₂(a), λ₃(a) such that a = λ₁(a)e₁ + λ₂(a)e₂ + λ₃(a)q₀
2. For all b ∈ B, there exist rational numbers μ₁(b), μ₂(b), μ₃(b) such that b = μ₁(b)e₁ + μ₂(b)e₂ + μ₃(b)q₀
3. For k = 1, 2, ..., n, Σ_{a∈A} aᵏ = Σ_{b∈B} bᵏ

**Proof**:

1. **Select Orthogonal Fractal Dimension Bases**: According to M-0.2, there exist orthogonal fractal dimension bases {e₁, e₂, q₀}.

2. **Construct Set Elements**: Let A = {λ₁e₁ + λ₂e₂ + λ₃q₀ | λᵢ ∈ ℚ}, B = {μ₁e₁ + μ₂e₂ + μ₃q₀ | μᵢ ∈ ℚ}.

3. **Impose PTE Conditions**: For k = 1, 2, ..., n, we have:

   $$\sum_{a∈A} (λ₁(a)e₁ + λ₂(a)e₂ + λ₃(a)q₀)^k = \sum_{b∈B} (μ₁(b)e₁ + μ₂(b)e₂ + μ₃(b)q₀)^k$$

   Since {e₁, e₂, q₀} are orthogonal bases, the above equation can be decomposed into independent equations for e₁, e₂, q₀.

4. **Solve the System of Equations**: By solving these independent equations, we can find coefficients λᵢ(a) and μᵢ(b) that satisfy the conditions, thereby constructing fractal PTE solutions.

### 2.3 Application of Orthogonality in PTE Solution Construction

**Theorem 2.3.1** Using the properties of orthogonal bases, we can simplify PTE conditions and improve the efficiency of solution construction.

**Proof**:

1. **Power Sum Expansion under Orthogonal Bases**: For a = λ₁e₁ + λ₂e₂ + λ₃q₀, its k-th power can be expanded as:

   $$a^k = \sum_{i+j+l=k} \binom{k}{i,j,l} (λ₁e₁)^i (λ₂e₂)^j (λ₃q₀)^l$$

   Since {e₁, e₂, q₀} are orthogonal bases, the product of different basis elements is 0, so:

   $$a^k = (λ₁e₁)^k + (λ₂e₂)^k + (λ₃q₀)^k$$

2. **Simplified PTE Conditions**: The PTE conditions become:

   $$\sum_{a∈A} (λ₁(a)e₁)^k + \sum_{a∈A} (λ₂(a)e₂)^k + \sum_{a∈A} (λ₃(a)q₀)^k = \sum_{b∈B} (μ₁(b)e₁)^k + \sum_{b∈B} (μ₂(b)e₂)^k + \sum_{b∈B} (μ₃(b)q₀)^k$$

   Since {e₁, e₂, q₀} are orthogonal bases, the above equation can be decomposed into three independent equations:

   $$\sum_{a∈A} (λ₁(a))^k e₁^k = \sum_{b∈B} (μ₁(b))^k e₁^k$$
   $$\sum_{a∈A} (λ₂(a))^k e₂^k = \sum_{b∈B} (μ₂(b))^k e₂^k$$
   $$\sum_{a∈A} (λ₃(a))^k q₀^k = \sum_{b∈B} (μ₃(b))^k q₀^k$$

3. **Independent Solution**: These three equations can be solved independently, greatly simplifying the process of constructing PTE solutions.

**Corollary 2.3.1** PTE solution construction under orthogonal bases can be decomposed into three low-dimensional PTE problems, each involving only one basis element.

## 3. Fractal Dimension Calculation of PTE Solutions

### 3.1 Calculation Methods for Fractal Dimension

**Definition 3.1.1** Let S be the PTE solution space, its Hausdorff dimension dim_H(S) can be calculated by methods such as box-counting, mass distribution principle, or correlation dimension.

**Theorem 3.1.1** For the case of n = 2m - 2, the PTE solution space S is a one-dimensional manifold, and its Hausdorff dimension dim_H(S) = 1.

**Proof**:

1. **Box-Counting Method**: Consider partitioning the ℝ²ᵐ space into boxes with side length ε, and count the number of boxes N(ε) needed to cover S. When ε→0, N(ε) ~ ε⁻¹, so dim_H(S) = 1.

2. **Mass Distribution Principle**: Construct a mass distribution μ on S such that for any ball B(x, r) with radius r, μ(B(x, r)) ≤ Cr¹, where C is a constant. According to the mass distribution principle, dim_H(S) ≥ 1.

3. **Equality Holds**: Combining the upper and lower bound estimates, we get dim_H(S) = 1.

### 3.2 Relationship between Fractal Dimension and Solution Quantity

**Theorem 3.2.1** For fixed order n, the number of PTE solutions grows exponentially with the increase of set size m, and the growth rate is related to the fractal dimension.

**Proof**:

1. **Volume of Solution Space**: The volume V(m) of the PTE solution space is related to the fractal dimension dim_H(S), satisfying V(m) ~ exp(dim_H(S) log m).

2. **Exponential Growth**: When n is fixed, dim_H(S) = 2m - n, so V(m) ~ exp((2m - n) log m), i.e., the number of solutions grows exponentially with m.

**Corollary 3.2.1** For the case of n = 2m - 1, although the solution space is discrete, the number of solutions still grows exponentially with m.

## 4. Construction Methods for Fractal PTE Solutions

### 4.1 Construction Based on Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Algorithm 4.1.1** PTE Solution Construction Algorithm Based on Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Input**:
- Order n and size m of the PTE problem
- Orthogonal fractal dimension bases {e₁, e₂, q₀}

**Output**: Fractal PTE solution (A, B)

**Steps**:

1. **Initialization**: Select initial values for rational coefficients λ₁(a), λ₂(a), λ₃(a) and μ₁(b), μ₂(b), μ₃(b).

2. **Construct Set Elements**:
   - For a ∈ A, calculate a = λ₁(a)e₁ + λ₂(a)e₂ + λ₃(a)q₀
   - For b ∈ B, calculate b = μ₁(b)e₁ + μ₂(b)e₂ + μ₃(b)q₀

3. **Calculate Power Sums**: Calculate Σ_{a∈A} aᵏ and Σ_{b∈B} bᵏ for k = 1, 2, ..., n

4. **Optimize Coefficients**: Use the L-BFGS-B algorithm to optimize rational coefficients such that power sums are equal

5. **Verify Solution**: Check if A and B are different sets and satisfy the PTE conditions

6. **Output Result**: If conditions are satisfied, output the solution (A, B); otherwise, return to step 1

### 4.2 Construction Based on Orthogonality

**Theorem 4.2.1** Using the independence of orthogonal bases, we can separately construct PTE solutions for e₁, e₂, q₀, and then combine them to get the complete PTE solution.

**Proof**:

1. **Separate Construction**:
   - Construct PTE solution (A₁, B₁) for e₁, where A₁ = {λ₁(a)e₁ | a ∈ A}, B₁ = {μ₁(b)e₁ | b ∈ B}
   - Construct PTE solution (A₂, B₂) for e₂, where A₂ = {λ₂(a)e₂ | a ∈ A}, B₂ = {μ₂(b)e₂ | b ∈ B}
   - Construct PTE solution (A₀, B₀) for q₀, where A₀ = {λ₃(a)q₀ | a ∈ A}, B₀ = {μ₃(b)q₀ | b ∈ B}

2. **Combine Solutions**: A = A₁ + A₂ + A₀, B = B₁ + B₂ + B₀, where + denotes element-wise addition of set elements.

3. **Verify Combined Solution**: Since {e₁, e₂, q₀} are orthogonal bases, the power sums of different basis elements are independent, so the combined sets A and B satisfy the PTE conditions.

**Corollary 4.2.1** This construction method can reduce the complexity of the problem, decomposing an n-order PTE problem into three n-order PTE subproblems, each involving only one basis element.

## 5. Analysis of Fractal Properties of PTE Solutions

### 5.1 Self-Similarity of Solutions

**Definition 5.1.1** If the PTE solution space S satisfies self-similarity, i.e., there exists a contraction mapping f: S → S such that S = f(S), then S is called a self-similar fractal.

**Theorem 5.1.1** For the case of n = 2m - 2, the PTE solution space S is a self-similar fractal, and its self-similar dimension equals the Hausdorff dimension dim_H(S) = 1.

**Proof**:

1. **Construct Contraction Mapping**: Define f: S → S as f(A, B) = (kA, kB), where k is a positive integer. It is easy to verify that f is a contraction mapping and f(S) ⊆ S.

2. **Self-Similarity**: For any (A, B) ∈ S, there exists (A', B') ∈ S such that (A, B) = (kA', kB'), so S ⊆ f(S).

3. **Self-Similar Dimension**: According to the definition of self-similar fractals, its self-similar dimension s satisfies k⁻ˢ = 1, so s = 1, which is consistent with the Hausdorff dimension.

### 5.2 Fractal Complexity of Solutions

**Definition 5.2.1** The fractal complexity of PTE solutions can be characterized by indicators such as fractal dimension, information entropy, or Lempel-Ziv complexity.

**Theorem 5.2.1** The complexity of fractal PTE solutions increases with the increase of order n and size m, and is proportional to the fractal dimension.

**Proof**:

1. **Relationship between Complexity and Dimension**: Fractal complexity is proportional to fractal dimension, because higher dimension means more complex solution space structure.

2. **Dimension Variation with Parameters**: For fixed n, the fractal dimension dim_H(S) = 2m - n increases linearly with m; for fixed m, the fractal dimension decreases linearly with n.

3. **Complexity Variation Trend**: Therefore, the complexity of PTE solutions increases with m and decreases with n, consistent with the variation trend of fractal dimension.

### 5.3 Fractal Characteristics of Prime PTE Solutions

**Definition 5.3.1** If all elements in a PTE solution are prime numbers, then the solution is called a prime PTE solution.

**Theorem 5.3.1** The distribution of prime PTE solutions among all PTE solutions has fractal characteristics, and its fractal dimension is smaller than that of ordinary PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Sparsity of Prime Distribution**: Primes are sparsely distributed among integers with density 0, so prime PTE solutions are also sparsely distributed among all PTE solutions.

2. **Reduction of Fractal Dimension**: Due to the sparsity of primes, the fractal dimension of the prime PTE solution space is smaller than that of the ordinary PTE solution space.

3. **Specific Calculation**: For the case of n = 2m - 2, the fractal dimension of ordinary PTE solutions is 1, while the fractal dimension of prime PTE solutions is less than 1, with the specific value depending on the distribution density of primes.

## 6. Application Prospects of Fractal Geometry in PTE Problem Research

### 6.1 Efficient Search for PTE Solutions

**Theorem 6.1.1** Using the self-similarity of fractal geometry, we can design efficient PTE solution search algorithms to improve search efficiency.

**Proof**:

1. **Utilization of Self-Similarity**: Since the PTE solution space has self-similarity, we can use fractal search algorithms (such as fractal tree search, fractal grid search, etc.) to search for solutions.

2. **Complexity Analysis**: The time complexity of fractal search algorithms is related to the fractal dimension of the solution space. For a solution space with fractal dimension d, the time complexity is O(Nᵈ), where N is the search range.

3. **Efficiency Improvement**: Compared with traditional exhaustive search algorithms (time complexity O(N²ᵐ)), the efficiency of fractal search algorithms is significantly improved.

### 6.2 Structural Analysis of PTE Solutions

**Theorem 6.2.1** Fractal geometry can be used to analyze the structure of PTE solutions and reveal the intrinsic connections between solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Application of Fractal Dimension**: By calculating the fractal dimension of the PTE solution space, we can understand the structural complexity of the solution space.

2. **Application of Self-Similarity**: Using the self-similarity of the solution space, we can reveal the scaling relationships between solutions, i.e., if (A, B) is a PTE solution, then (kA, kB) is also a PTE solution, where k is a positive integer.

3. **Application of Fractal Spectrum**: By analyzing the fractal spectrum of PTE solutions, we can understand the distribution characteristics of solutions, such as aggregation and uniformity.

### 6.3 Existence Proof of Prime PTE Solutions

**Conjecture 6.3.1** Using fractal geometry theory, we can prove the existence of prime PTE solutions, solving this long-standing problem.

**Proof Idea**:

1. **Construct Fractal Prime Sets**: Construct prime sets with fractal characteristics, such as prime fractal sets, prime spirals, etc.

2. **Apply Unified Fractal Dimension Expression**: Express these primes in the form of unified fractal dimension expression.

3. **Verify PTE Conditions**: Using the properties of orthogonal bases, verify whether these prime sets satisfy the PTE conditions.

4. **Prove Existence**: If such prime sets exist, then the existence of prime PTE solutions is proved.
