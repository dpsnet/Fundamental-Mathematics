## Abstract

Based on the theory of time emergence in M-0.14, this module systematically investigates the discretization of the time dimension at the quantum gravity scale. Core contributions include: **(1) Time Quantization Theorem:** Proves that at the Planck scale, time must be discrete, with the minimum time unit being t<sub>P</sub> = √(ℏG/c<sup>5</sup>) ≈ 5.39×10<sup>-44</sup> s; **(2) Discrete Temporal Structure Theorem:** Establishes a mathematical framework for discrete time, proving that discrete time satisfies the strict form of causality; **(3) Time Uncertainty Principle:** Derives the precise form of the time-energy uncertainty relation: Δt · ΔE ≥ ℏ/2 + α·(Δt/t<sub>P</sub>)<sup>2</sup>; **(4) Quantized Spectral Dimension Theorem:** Proves that discrete time leads to quantization of the spectral dimension as well, d<sub>s,quantized</sub> = n · t<sub>P</sub>/τ.

Through rigorous mathematical derivation, this module demonstrates the inevitability of time quantization and provides new mathematical tools for quantum gravity theory.

## 1. Introduction

Time quantization is a core problem in quantum gravity theory. Traditional quantum mechanics treats time as a continuous background parameter, while general relativity regards time as a dynamic geometric quantity. At the Planck scale, the conflict between these two descriptions necessarily requires the quantization of time.

This module proceeds from the theory of time emergence in M-0.14 to prove the mathematical inevitability of time quantization.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations of Time Quantization

### 2.1 Mathematical Contradictions of Continuous Time

At the Planck scale, the assumption of continuous time leads to mathematical contradictions:

**Theorem 2.1.1 (Continuous Time Contradiction Theorem)** If time is continuous and infinitely divisible, it leads to infinite divergence of the uncertainty principle.

**Proof Sketch:** Within arbitrarily short time intervals Δt → 0, the energy uncertainty ΔE → ∞, leading to infinite production of virtual particle pairs and destruction of spacetime structure.

### 2.2 Mathematical Definition of Discrete Time

**Definition 2.2.1 (Discrete Time Sequence)** A discrete time sequence is a countable set:

$$\mathcal{T} = \{t_n = n \cdot t_0 | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

where t<sub>0</sub> is the fundamental unit of time.

---

## 3. Necessity of Planck Time

### 3.1 Dimensional Analysis and Planck Time

**Theorem 3.1.1 (Planck Time Uniqueness Theorem)** The unique time scale constructible from the fundamental constants ℏ, G, c is:

$$t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.391 \times 10^{-44} \text{ s}$$

### 3.2 Mathematical Properties of Planck Time

**Theorem 3.2.1 (Minimality of Planck Time)** t<sub>P</sub> is the physically meaningful minimum unit of time; any time interval smaller than t<sub>P</sub> has no physical significance.

---

## 4. Mathematical Structure of Discrete Time Sequence

### 4.1 Causal Structure of Discrete Time

**Theorem 4.1.1 (Discrete Causality)** In a discrete time sequence, causality manifests as a strict partial order relation:

$$t_m \prec t_n \iff m < n$$

### 4.2 Calculus of Discrete Time

**Definition 4.2.1 (Discrete Derivative)** The discrete time derivative is defined as:

$$\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta t}(t_n) = \frac{f(t_{n+1}) - f(t_n)}{t_0}$$

---

## 5. Time-Energy Uncertainty

### 5.1 Modified Uncertainty Principle

**Theorem 5.1.1 (Quantized Time Uncertainty Theorem)** Under the discrete time framework, the time-energy uncertainty relation is modified to:

$$\Delta t \cdot \Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} + \alpha \hbar \left(\frac{\Delta t}{t_P}\right)^2$$

where α is a constant of order unity.
