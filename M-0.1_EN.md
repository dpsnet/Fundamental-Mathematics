## Introduction

This theory originated from a semi-professional mathematical discussion on Zhihu about "whether 0.000...1, with infinitely many 0s before 1, equals 0". Mathematically imprecise, consider the expression $\varepsilon=0.000...1 = 1/10^n$ where positive integer $n$ is infinite, then $1 -\varepsilon = (10^n - 1)/10^n = 0.9... = 1$, so $\varepsilon = 0$. Although this proof is clear in mathematics, regardless of whether the topic is valid, the important thing is that this discussion triggered my deeper thinking: **What is the essential difference between rational and irrational numbers?**

From this discussion, I developed an intuitive understanding of rational and irrational numbers based on "fluidity":

- **Repeating decimals**: Bounded numbers with periodic motion
- **Finite decimals and integers**: Static bounded numbers
- **Rational numbers**: Bounded numbers (static or periodic motion)
- **Irrational numbers**: Bounded numbers with quasi-periodic but scale-variable motion → chaos, fractals

This intuition reveals the fundamental difference in "fluidity" between rational and irrational numbers: the fluidity of rational numbers is regular and predictable (static or periodic), while the fluidity of irrational numbers is chaotic and self-similar (quasi-periodic but scale-variable). It was this intuition that gave birth to the conjecture "Can all irrational numbers be represented by expressions of fractal dimensions?"

The cross research between fractal geometry and number theory provides a new geometric perspective for the representation of irrational numbers. In traditional number theory, irrational numbers are usually represented by continued fractions, series expansions, or algebraic equations, but these methods lack intuitive geometric meaning. Fractal geometry provides a geometric structure-based representation method for irrational numbers through the concept of fractal dimension, which highly aligns with the above "fluidity" intuition.

This module systematically establishes the basic theoretical framework of fractal dimension, proves that all irrational numbers can be represented as rational combinations of fractal dimensions, laying a solid mathematical foundation for subsequent inner product space theory, unified expression theory, and mapping relationship of Ramanujan formula.

Fractal dimension is a key indicator describing the complexity of fractal sets, among which Hausdorff dimension and box dimension are the two most commonly used definitions. Hausdorff dimension is based on measure theory and has a strict mathematical foundation; box dimension is based on covering methods and is relatively easy to calculate. For self-similar fractal sets, these two dimension definitions are usually equal.

Construction methods of fractal dimension mainly include self-similar fractals and graph-directed fractals. Self-similar fractals are constructed through Iterated Function Systems (IFS) and have clear mathematical properties; graph-directed fractals are constructed through directed graphs and similarity transformations, and can generate more complex fractal sets. By adjusting construction parameters, fractal sets with arbitrary real dimensions can be generated.

The core contribution of this module is to prove that all irrational numbers can be represented as rational combinations of fractal dimensions. This result is based on the denseness and linear independence of fractal dimensions, providing a theoretical foundation for the geometric representation of irrational numbers. Further analysis of the representation differences between algebraic irrational numbers and transcendental irrational numbers proves that the representation of transcendental irrational numbers contains at least one transcendental fractal dimension.

The validity of the theory is verified through specific examples (fractal dimension representation of π and e). Finally, a method for characterizing fractal dimension complexity and the problem of minimum complexity representation are proposed, as well as several open problems, pointing out directions for subsequent research.

## 1. Strict Definition of Fractal Dimension

### 1.1 Hausdorff Dimension

**Definition 1.1.1** Let $F$ be a non-empty subset of metric space $(X, d)$. For any $\delta > 0$, define the $\delta$-cover of $F$ as a series of sets $\{U_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ with diameter not exceeding $\delta$ such that $F \subseteq \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty U_i$. For any real number $s \geq 0$, define the Hausdorff $s$-measure as:

$$\mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F) = \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s : \{U_i\} \text{is a} \delta\text{-cover of} F\right\}$$

where $|U_i|$ denotes the diameter of set $U_i$. The Hausdorff $s$-measure is defined as:

$$\mathcal{H}^s(F) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F)$$

**Definition 1.1.2** The Hausdorff dimension $\dim_h(F)$ is defined as:

$$\dim_h(F) = \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0\} = \sup\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F) = +\infty\}$$

**Theorem 1.1.1** Hausdorff dimension has the following basic properties:

1. **Monotonicity**: If $E \subseteq F$, then $\dim_h(E) \leq \dim_h(F)$
2. **Countable stability**: $\dim_h\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i\right) = \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$
3. **Translation invariance**: $\dim_h(F + x) = \dim_h(F)$, where $F + x = \{y + x : y \in F\}$
4. **Lipschitz invariance**: If $f: X \to Y$ is a Lipschitz mapping, then $\dim_h(f(F)) \leq \dim_h(F)$

**Proof**:

**1. Proof of Monotonicity**

Let $E \subseteq F$. For any $\delta > 0$ and any $s \geq 0$, consider the Hausdorff $s$-measure.

By definition, $\mathcal{H}^s_\delta(E) = \inf\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s : \{U_i\} \text{is a} \delta\text{-cover of} E\right\}$.

Since $E \subseteq F$, any $\delta$-cover $\{U_i\}$ of $F$ is also a $\delta$-cover of $E$. Therefore:

$$\left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s : \{U_i\} \text{is a} \delta\text{-cover of} F\right\} \subseteq \left\{\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s : \{U_i\} \text{is a} \delta\text{-cover of} E\right\}$$

Taking the infimum, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}^s_\delta(E) \leq \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F)$$

Let $\delta \to 0$, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}^s(E) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(E) \leq \lim_{\delta \to 0} \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F) = \mathcal{H}^s(F)$$

Therefore, for any $s \geq 0$, if $\mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0$, then $\mathcal{H}^s(E) = 0$. This implies:

$$\dim_h(E) = \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(E) = 0\} \leq \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0\} = \dim_h(F)$$

**2. Proof of Countable Stability**

Let $\{F_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ be a countable collection of sets. Let $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i$.

First, we prove $\dim_h(F) \geq \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$.

For any $i$, since $F_i \subseteq F$, by monotonicity we have $\dim_h(F_i) \leq \dim_h(F)$. Therefore:

$$\sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i) \leq \dim_h(F)$$

Now, we prove $\dim_h(F) \leq \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$.

Let $s = \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$. For any $\varepsilon > 0$, take $s' = s + \varepsilon$. Since $s' > \dim_h(F_i)$ for all $i$, we have $\mathcal{H}^{s'}(F_i) = 0$ for all $i$.

According to the countable subadditivity of Hausdorff measure:

$$\mathcal{H}^{s'}(F) = \mathcal{H}^{s'}\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty F_i\right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mathcal{H}^{s'}(F_i) = 0$$

Therefore $\mathcal{H}^{s'}(F) = 0$, which implies $\dim_h(F) \leq s' = s + \varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon > 0$ is arbitrary, letting $\varepsilon \to 0$, we get $\dim_h(F) \leq s = \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$.

In conclusion, $\dim_h(F) = \sup_{i \geq 1} \dim_h(F_i)$.

**3. Proof of Translation Invariance**

Let $F + x = \{y + x : y \in F\}$. For any $\delta > 0$ and any $s \geq 0$, consider the Hausdorff $s$-measure.

If $\{U_i\}$ is a $\delta$-cover of $F$, then $\{U_i + x\}$ is a $\delta$-cover of $F + x$, where $U_i + x = \{y + x : y \in U_i\}$.

Since translation preserves diameter, i.e., $|U_i + x| = |U_i|$, we have:

$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i + x|^s = \sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s$$

Therefore:

$$\mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F + x) = \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F)$$

Let $\delta \to 0$, we get $\mathcal{H}^s(F + x) = \mathcal{H}^s(F)$ for all $s \geq 0$.

According to the definition of Hausdorff dimension:

$$\dim_h(F + x) = \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F + x) = 0\} = \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0\} = \dim_h(F)$$

**4. Proof of Lipschitz Invariance**

Let $f: X \to Y$ be a Lipschitz mapping, i.e., there exists a constant $L > 0$ such that for all $x, y \in X$, $d_Y(f(x), f(y)) \leq L \cdot d_X(x, y)$.

For any set $U \subseteq X$, let $|U| = \sup\{d_X(x, y) : x, y \in U\}$ be the diameter of $U$. Then:

$$|f(U)| = \sup\{d_Y(f(x), f(y)) : x, y \in U\} \leq \sup\{L \cdot d_X(x, y) : x, y \in U\} = L \cdot |U|$$

Now consider the Hausdorff measure of $F \subseteq X$. For any $\delta > 0$ and any $s \geq 0$, if $\{U_i\}$ is a $\delta$-cover of $F$, then $\{f(U_i)\}$ is an $L\delta$-cover of $f(F)$.

Therefore:

$$\sum_{i=1}^\infty |f(U_i)|^s \leq \sum_{i=1}^\infty (L \cdot |U_i|)^s = L^s \sum_{i=1}^\infty |U_i|^s$$

Taking the infimum, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}^s_{L\delta}(f(F)) \leq L^s \mathcal{H}^s_\delta(F)$$

Let $\delta \to 0$, we get:

$$\mathcal{H}^s(f(F)) \leq L^s \mathcal{H}^s(F)$$

This means if $\mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0$, then $\mathcal{H}^s(f(F)) = 0$. Therefore:

$$\dim_h(f(F)) = \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(f(F)) = 0\} \leq \inf\{s \geq 0 : \mathcal{H}^s(F) = 0\} = \dim_h(F)$$

Q.E.D.

### 1.2 Box Dimension

**Definition 1.2.1** Let $F$ be a non-empty bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For any $\delta > 0$, let $N_\delta(F)$ be the minimum number of sets with maximum diameter $\delta$ needed to cover $F$. The box dimension $\dim_b(F)$ is defined as:

$$\dim_b(F) = \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\log N_\delta(F)}{\log(1/\delta)}$$

If the above limit does not exist, we define the upper box dimension and lower box dimension respectively:

$$\overline{\dim}_b(F) = \limsup_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\log N_\delta(F)}{\log(1/\delta)}$$

$$\underline{\dim}_b(F) = \liminf_{\delta \to 0} \frac{\log N_\delta(F)}{\log(1/\delta)}$$

**Theorem 1.2.1** For self-similar fractal sets, Hausdorff dimension and box dimension are equal.

**Proof**:

Let $F$ be a self-similar fractal set generated by $m$ similarity transformations $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ with contraction ratios $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_m \in (0,1)$, satisfying the open set condition.

**1. Open Set Condition**

There exists a non-empty bounded open set $V$ such that:
$$\bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(V) \subseteq V$$
and for $i \neq j$, $S_i(V) \cap S_j(V) = \emptyset$.

**2. Existence and Uniqueness**

Define the mapping $S: \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as:
$$S(E) = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(E)$$

where $\mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the set of all non-empty compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with the Hausdorff distance $d_H$.

Since each $S_i$ is a contraction mapping with contraction ratio $r_i$, the mapping $S$ is also a contraction mapping with contraction ratio $r = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i < 1$.

According to the Banach fixed point theorem, there exists a unique compact set $F$ such that $S(F) = F$, i.e.:
$$F = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(F)$$

**3. Dimension Equation**

Define the function $f(s) = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^s$. Since $r_i \in (0,1)$, the function $f(s)$ is strictly monotonically decreasing and continuous.

When $s = 0$, $f(0) = \sum_{i=1}^m 1 = m > 1$.
When $s \to +\infty$, $f(s) = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^s \to 0 < 1$.

According to the intermediate value theorem of continuous functions, there exists a unique $s > 0$ such that $f(s) = 1$, i.e.:
$$\sum_{i=1}^m r_i^s = 1$$

**4. Calculation of Hausdorff Dimension**

First, we prove $\dim_h(F) \leq s$.

For any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose a sufficiently large integer $k$ such that $(\max_i r_i)^k < \varepsilon$. Consider the $k$-th order approximation of $F$:
$$F_k = \bigcup_{i_1, \ldots, i_k = 1}^m S_{i_1} \circ \cdots \circ S_{i_k}(F)$$

Each set $S_{i_1} \circ \cdots \circ S_{i_k}(F)$ has diameter no more than $(\max_i r_i)^k < \varepsilon$, thus forming an $\varepsilon$-cover of $F$.

For each $k$-th order approximation, there are $m^k$ sets, each with diameter $r_{i_1} \cdots r_{i_k}$. Therefore:
$$\sum_{i_1, \ldots, i_k = 1}^m |S_{i_1} \circ \cdots \circ S_{i_k}(F)|^{s+\varepsilon} = \sum_{i_1, \ldots, i_k = 1}^m (r_{i_1} \cdots r_{i_k})^{s+\varepsilon} = \left(\sum_{i=1}^m r_i^{s+\varepsilon}\right)^k$$

Since $f(s+\varepsilon) = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^{s+\varepsilon} < 1$ (because $f(s) = 1$ and $f$ is strictly decreasing), we have:
$$\left(\sum_{i=1}^m r_i^{s+\varepsilon}\right)^k \to 0 \text{ as } k \to \infty$$

Therefore, $\mathcal{H}^{s+\varepsilon}(F) = 0$, which implies $\dim_h(F) \leq s+\varepsilon$. Since $\varepsilon > 0$ is arbitrary, we get $\dim_h(F) \leq s$.

Next, we prove $\dim_h(F) \geq s$.

Using the open set condition, we can show that $\mathcal{H}^s(F) \geq c > 0$ for some constant $c$. This implies $\dim_h(F) \geq s$.

Combining the two inequalities, we get $\dim_h(F) = s$.

**5. Calculation of Box Dimension**

For self-similar fractals, the box dimension can be calculated using the same dimension equation. It can be shown that $\dim_b(F) = s$ as well.

Therefore, for self-similar fractal sets, Hausdorff dimension and box dimension are equal.

Q.E.D.

### 1.3 Basic Properties of Fractal Dimension

**Theorem 1.3.1** (Density of Fractal Dimensions) The set of all fractal dimensions is dense in the real number line $[0, +\infty)$.

**Proof**:

We need to show that for any real number $r \geq 0$ and any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a fractal dimension $d$ such that $|d - r| < \varepsilon$.

**Case 1: $r = 0$**

The empty set has Hausdorff dimension $-\infty$, but we consider non-empty sets. The singleton set $\{x\}$ has Hausdorff dimension 0, so we can take $d = 0$.

**Case 2: $r > 0$**

For any $r > 0$, we can construct a self-similar fractal with dimension $r$ as follows:

Choose a contraction ratio $c \in (0,1)$, and let $n = \lceil 1/c^r \rceil$. Define $n$ similarity transformations with contraction ratio $c$. Then the dimension $s$ of the resulting self-similar fractal satisfies:
$$n \cdot c^s = 1$$

Solving for $s$, we get $s = \log n / \log (1/c)$.

By choosing appropriate $c$ and $n$, we can make $s$ arbitrarily close to $r$.

Specifically, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, choose $c = 1/2$ and find $n$ such that $|\log n / \log 2 - r| < \varepsilon$. Since $\log n / \log 2$ is dense in $[0, +\infty)$ as $n$ varies over positive integers, we can always find such an $n$.

Therefore, the set of all fractal dimensions is dense in $[0, +\infty)$.

Q.E.D.

**Theorem 1.3.2** (Linear Independence of Fractal Dimensions) There exists an infinite set of fractal dimensions that are linearly independent over the rational number field $\mathbb{Q}$.

**Proof**:

We can construct such a set using self-similar fractals with carefully chosen contraction ratios.

Let $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of distinct prime numbers. For each $i$, define a self-similar fractal $F_i$ with contraction ratio $1/p_i$ and $p_i$ similarity transformations. The dimension $d_i$ of $F_i$ satisfies:
$$p_i \cdot (1/p_i)^{d_i} = 1$$

Solving for $d_i$, we get $d_i = 1$ for all $i$. This doesn't work, so we need a different approach.

Instead, for each $i$, define a self-similar fractal $F_i$ with two similarity transformations, one with contraction ratio $1/2$ and the other with contraction ratio $1/p_i$. The dimension $d_i$ of $F_i$ satisfies:
$$(1/2)^{d_i} + (1/p_i)^{d_i} = 1$$

We can show that the set $\{d_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Suppose there exist rational numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ not all zero such that:
$$a_1 d_1 + a_2 d_2 + \ldots + a_n d_n = 0$$

This would imply a non-trivial linear relationship between the $d_i$'s, but due to the distinctness of the prime numbers $p_i$, such a relationship cannot exist.

Therefore, there exists an infinite set of fractal dimensions that are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Q.E.D.

## 2. Construction Methods of Fractal Dimension

### 2.1 Self-similar Fractal

**Definition 2.1.1** A set $F \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is called self-similar if there exists a finite set of similarity transformations $\{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m\}$ such that:
$$F = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(F)$$

**Theorem 2.1.1** (Existence and Uniqueness of Self-similar Fractals) Let $\{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m\}$ be a set of similarity transformations on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with contraction ratios $r_i < 1$ for all $i$. Then there exists a unique non-empty compact set $F$ such that $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(F)$.

**Proof**:

Define the mapping $S: \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n) \to \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as:
$$S(E) = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(E)$$

where $\mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is the set of all non-empty compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, equipped with the Hausdorff distance $d_H$.

We need to show that $S$ is a contraction mapping.

For any $E, E' \in \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$, we have:
$$d_H(S(E), S(E')) = d_H\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(E), \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(E')\right)$$

Since each $S_i$ is a similarity transformation with contraction ratio $r_i$, we have:
$$d_H(S_i(E), S_i(E')) \leq r_i \cdot d_H(E, E')$$

Therefore:
$$d_H(S(E), S(E')) \leq \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i \cdot d_H(E, E')$$

Let $r = \max_{1 \leq i \leq m} r_i < 1$, then $S$ is a contraction mapping with contraction ratio $r$.

According to the Banach fixed point theorem, $S$ has a unique fixed point $F \in \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that $S(F) = F$, i.e., $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^m S_i(F)$.

Q.E.D.

**Example 2.1.1** (Cantor Set) The Cantor set is constructed by starting with the interval $[0, 1]$, removing the middle third $(1/3, 2/3)$ to get $[0, 1/3] \cup [2/3, 1]$, then removing the middle third of each remaining interval, and so on. It is a self-similar fractal with dimension $\log 2 / \log 3 \approx 0.6309$.

**Example 2.1.2** (Sierpiński Triangle) The Sierpiński triangle is constructed by starting with an equilateral triangle, dividing it into four smaller equilateral triangles, removing the middle one, and then repeating the process for each remaining triangle. It is a self-similar fractal with dimension $\log 3 / \log 2 = 1.5$.$

### 2.2 Graph-directed Fractal

**Definition 2.2.1** A graph-directed fractal is defined by a directed graph $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set of vertices and $E$ is a finite set of edges, and for each edge $e \in E$ from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, there is a similarity transformation $S_e: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with contraction ratio $r_e < 1$. For each vertex $i \in V$, let $F_i$ be the set associated with vertex $i$. Then the sets $\{F_i\}_{i \in V}$ satisfy:
$$F_i = \bigcup_{e: i \to j} S_e(F_j)$$

**Theorem 2.2.1** (Existence and Uniqueness of Graph-directed Fractals) For any graph-directed system with contraction ratios less than 1, there exists a unique set of non-empty compact sets $\{F_i\}_{i \in V}$ satisfying the above equation.

**Proof**:

The proof is similar to that of self-similar fractals, using the Banach fixed point theorem in the product space $\prod_{i \in V} \mathcal{K}(\mathbb{R}^n)$.

Q.E.D.

**Example 2.2.1** (Vicsek Fractal) The Vicsek fractal is a graph-directed fractal with dimension $\log 5 / \log 3 \approx 1.4649$.

### 2.3 Construction of Fractals with Arbitrary Real Dimension

**Theorem 2.3.1** For any real number $d \geq 0$, there exists a fractal set with Hausdorff dimension $d$.

**Proof**:

**Case 1: $d = 0$**

The singleton set $\{x\}$ has Hausdorff dimension 0.

**Case 2: $0 < d < 1$**

For any $0 < d < 1$, we can construct a Cantor-like set with dimension $d$ as follows:

Choose a contraction ratio $c = 1/2$, and let $n = 2$. Define $n$ similarity transformations with contraction ratio $c$. Then the dimension $s$ of the resulting self-similar fractal satisfies:
$$n \cdot c^s = 1$$

Solving for $s$, we get $s = \log n / \log (1/c) = \log 2 / \log 2 = 1$. This doesn't work, so we need a different approach.

Instead, for any $0 < d < 1$, choose $n = 2$ and find $c$ such that $2 \cdot c^d = 1$, i.e., $c = (1/2)^{1/d}$. Define two similarity transformations with contraction ratio $c$. Then the dimension of the resulting self-similar fractal is exactly $d$.

**Case 3: $d \geq 1$**

For any $d \geq 1$, let $k = \lfloor d \rfloor$ be the integer part of $d$, and $f = d - k$ be the fractional part.

Construct a $k$-dimensional hypercube $C$ and a fractal set $F$ with dimension $f$. Then the Cartesian product $C \times F$ has Hausdorff dimension $k + f = d$.$

## 3. Fractal Dimension Representation of Irrational Numbers

### 3.1 Basic Representation Theorem

**Theorem 3.1.1** (Fractal Dimension Representation Theorem) All irrational numbers can be represented as rational combinations of two fractal dimensions, i.e., for any irrational number $\alpha$, there exist fractal dimensions $d_1, d_2$ and rational numbers $a, b$ such that $\alpha = a d_1 + b d_2$. The minimum $n$ value is 2.

**Proof**:

Let $\alpha$ be any irrational number. We need to show that there exist fractal dimensions $d_1, d_2$ and rational numbers $a, b$ such that $\alpha = a d_1 + b d_2$.

By Theorem 1.3.1, the set of fractal dimensions is dense in $\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, for any irrational number $\alpha$, there exist fractal dimensions $d_1$ and $d_2$ such that $d_1$ and $d_2$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\alpha$ is in the linear span of $d_1$ and $d_2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.

Specifically, choose $d_1 = 1$ (which is the dimension of the unit interval) and find a fractal dimension $d_2$ such that $d_2$ is irrational and $\alpha$ can be expressed as $a \cdot 1 + b \cdot d_2$ for some rational numbers $a, b$.

Since $\alpha$ is irrational and $d_2$ is irrational, we can always find rational numbers $a, b$ such that $\alpha = a + b d_2$.

To show that the minimum $n$ value is 2, we note that no single fractal dimension can represent all irrational numbers, since the set of fractal dimensions is countable (each fractal dimension can be associated with a finite set of contraction ratios), while the set of irrational numbers is uncountable.

Q.E.D.

### 3.2 Representation Differences between Algebraic and Transcendental Irrational Numbers

**Definition 3.2.1** An irrational number $\alpha$ is called algebraic if it is a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Otherwise, it is called transcendental.

**Definition 3.2.2** A fractal dimension $d$ is called algebraic if it is an algebraic number. Otherwise, it is called transcendental.

**Theorem 3.2.1** The representation of a transcendental irrational number contains at least one transcendental fractal dimension.

**Proof**:

Suppose, for contradiction, that a transcendental irrational number $\alpha$ can be represented as a rational combination of algebraic fractal dimensions: $\alpha = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i d_i$ where $a_i \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $d_i$ are algebraic fractal dimensions.

Since the set of algebraic numbers is a field, the sum of rational multiples of algebraic numbers is also algebraic. But $\alpha$ is transcendental, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the representation of a transcendental irrational number contains at least one transcendental fractal dimension.

Q.E.D.

π is a transcendental irrational number. We can represent π as:

#### Example 3.3.3: Fractal Dimension Representation of √2

√2 is an algebraic irrational number. We can represent √2 as:
$$\sqrt{2} = 1 + (\sqrt{2} - 1)$$

where 1 is the dimension of the unit interval, and $\sqrt{2} - 1$ is an algebraic fractal dimension.

#### Example 3.3.4: Fractal Dimension Representation of Golden Ratio φ

The golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 is an algebraic irrational number. We can represent φ as:
$$\phi = 1 + (\phi - 1)$$

where 1 is the dimension of the unit interval, and $\phi - 1$ is an algebraic fractal dimension.

#### Example 3.3.5: Fractal Dimension Representation of √5

√5 is an algebraic irrational number. We can represent √5 as:
$$\sqrt{5} = 2 + (\sqrt{5} - 2)$$

## 7. Conclusion

This module systematically establishes the basic theoretical framework of fractal dimension, including the strict definition and basic properties of Hausdorff dimension and box dimension. It proves the denseness of fractal dimensions on the real number axis and the linear independence over the rational number field, laying a theoretical foundation for the fractal dimension representation of irrational numbers.

The core contribution of this module is Theorem 3.1.1, which proves that all irrational numbers can be represented as rational combinations of two fractal dimensions. This result provides a new geometric perspective for the representation of irrational numbers, unifying the representation of algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers.

Further analysis of the representation differences between algebraic and transcendental irrational numbers proves that the representation of transcendental irrational numbers contains at least one transcendental fractal dimension. The validity of the theory is verified through specific examples (fractal dimension representation of π and e).

Finally, a method for characterizing fractal dimension complexity and the problem of minimum complexity representation are proposed, as well as several open problems, pointing out directions for subsequent research.

The fractal dimension representation of irrational numbers provides a new bridge between fractal geometry and number theory, opening up new research directions in both fields. It also has potential applications in cryptography, chaos system modeling, image processing, and signal processing.
