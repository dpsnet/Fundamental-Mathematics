## Introduction

Fiber bundle theory, as a frontier interdisciplinary field of modern mathematics and physics, provides a profound geometric framework for understanding spacetime structure, fundamental interactions, and quantum field theory. In the Fixed 4D Topology-Dynamic Spectral Dimension Multi-Twist Fractal Clifford Algebra Unified Field Theory, geometric, topological, and dynamic index parameters of fiber bundles play core roles. They are not only important criteria for theory self-consistency but also key observables for experimental verification.

This paper systematically expounds fiber bundle index parameter measurement methods based on this unified field theory, including geometric indices (connection, curvature, torsion), topological indices (Chern classes, Euler characteristic, Betti numbers), and dynamic indices (spectral dimension, torsion strength, measure field coupling constant), including their definitions, calculation methods, and experimental verification approaches. At the same time, this paper analyzes measurement capabilities of current research equipment, required precision, and phased measurement strategies, providing operable implementation plans for experimental testing of unified field theory.

Through precise measurement of fiber bundle index parameters, we can not only verify the correctness of unified field theory but also deeply explore the essence of spacetime, origin of mass, and geometric foundation of interactions, opening new directions for future development of physics.
