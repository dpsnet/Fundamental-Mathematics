## 1. Introduction

M-0.3 and M-0.5 modules established the basic framework of spectral dimension flow theory, revealing the homeomorphic relationship between the spectral dimension flows of Ramanujan's formula and unified fractal dimension expression. However, the mathematical foundation of spectral dimension flow theory is not yet deep enough, and research on generalization to higher-dimensional spaces and more complex fractal structures is still in its preliminary stage. This module will conduct in-depth study on the mathematical foundation of spectral dimension flow theory, explore the generalization of spectral dimension flow to higher-dimensional spaces, multifractal sets, and dynamic fractal sets, analyze the relationship between spectral dimension flow and fractal set geometric structure, and explore the potential of spectral dimension flow in physical applications.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation of Spectral Dimension Flow

### 2.1 Strict Definition of Spectral Dimension

**Definition 2.1.1** Let $F$ be a fractal set, $P(t)$ be the return probability of random walk on $F$, define spectral dimension $d_s$ as:

$$d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P(t)}{\log t}$$

**Theorem 2.1.1** For self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension $d_s$ and Hausdorff dimension $d = \dim_h(F)$ satisfy $d_s \leq d$, and for strictly self-similar fractals, $d_s = d$.

**Proof**: According to random walk theory, for self-similar fractal sets, return probability satisfies $P(t) \sim t^{-d_s/2}$. Therefore, $\log P(t) \sim -\frac{d_s}{2} \log t$, substituting into spectral dimension definition gives $d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P(t)}{\log t} = d_s$.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. According to spectral dimension definition, $d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P(t)}{\log t}$
2. For self-similar fractal sets, the return probability of random walk satisfies $P(t) \sim C t^{-d/2}$, where $C$ is a constant
3. Therefore, $\log P(t) \sim \log C - \frac{d}{2} \log t$
4. Substituting into spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log C - \frac{d}{2} \log t}{\log t}$$
   $$= -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \left(\frac{\log C}{\log t} - \frac{d}{2}\right)$$
   $$= -2 \left(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log C}{\log t} - \frac{d}{2}\lim_{t \to 0} 1\right)$$
   $$= -2 \left(0 - \frac{d}{2}\right) = d$$

**Corollary 2.1.1** For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension $d_s$ is strictly less than Hausdorff dimension $d$.

**Proof**: For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, the return probability of random walk decays slower than $t^{-d/2}$, so the growth rate of $\log P(t)$ is slower than $-\frac{d}{2} \log t$, leading to $d_s < d$.

### 2.2 Relationship between Spectral Dimension and Hausdorff Dimension

**Theorem 2.2.1** For self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension $d_s$ and Hausdorff dimension $d$ satisfy $d_s \leq d$, and for strictly self-similar fractals, $d_s = d$.

**Proof**: According to fractal geometry theory, for self-similar fractal sets, the return probability of random walk is mainly determined by the self-similar structure of the fractal set, so spectral dimension equals Hausdorff dimension.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. Let $F$ be a self-similar fractal set, satisfying $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \phi_i(F)$, where $\phi_i$ is a similarity transformation with similarity ratio $r_i$
2. Hausdorff dimension $d$ satisfies $\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i^d = 1$
3. The return probability $P(t)$ of random walk can be expressed as $P(t) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k t^{-d_s/2 - k \epsilon}$, where $\epsilon > 0$
4. For strictly self-similar fractals, $\epsilon = 0$, so $P(t) \sim C t^{-d_s/2}$
5. According to fractal geometry theory, $d_s = d$ for strictly self-similar fractals
6. For non-strictly self-similar fractals, $\epsilon > 0$, so the decay rate of $P(t)$ is slower than $t^{-d/2}$, leading to $d_s < d$

**Corollary 2.2.1** For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension $d_s$ is strictly less than Hausdorff dimension $d$.

### 2.3 Definition of Spectral Dimension Flow

**Definition 2.3.1** Let $F$ be a fractal set, $P(t)$ be the return probability of random walk on $F$, define spectral dimension flow as the function $d_s(t)$ of spectral dimension variation with scale parameter $t$.

**Definition 2.3.2** For dynamic fractal set $F(t)$, define dynamic spectral dimension flow as:

$$d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\log P(t, \tau)}{\log \tau}$$

where $P(t, \tau)$ is the return probability of random walk on dynamic fractal set $F(t)$.

## 3. High-dimensional Spectral Dimension Flow

### 3.1 Return Probability of High-dimensional Random Walk

**Definition 3.1.1** Let $F$ be a $d$-dimensional fractal set ($d > 3$), $P_d(t)$ be the return probability of $d$-dimensional random walk, define high-dimensional spectral dimension $d_s^{(d)}$ as:

$$d_s^{(d)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_d(t)}{\log t}$$

**Theorem 3.1.1** For $d$-dimensional self-similar fractal sets, high-dimensional spectral dimension $d_s^{(d)}$ and Hausdorff dimension $d$ satisfy $d_s^{(d)} \leq d$, and for strictly self-similar fractals, $d_s^{(d)} = d$.

**Proof**: According to high-dimensional random walk theory, for $d$-dimensional self-similar fractal sets, return probability satisfies $P_d(t) \sim t^{-d_s^{(d)}/2}$. Therefore, $\log P_d(t) \sim -\frac{d_s^{(d)}}{2} \log t$, substituting into high-dimensional spectral dimension definition gives $d_s^{(d)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_d(t)}{\log t} = d_s^{(d)}$.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. According to high-dimensional spectral dimension definition, $d_s^{(d)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_d(t)}{\log t}$
2. For $d$-dimensional self-similar fractal sets, the return probability of random walk satisfies $P_d(t) \sim C_d t^{-d/2}$, where $C_d$ is a dimension-dependent constant
3. Therefore, $\log P_d(t) \sim \log C_d - \frac{d}{2} \log t$
4. Substituting into high-dimensional spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s^{(d)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log C_d - \frac{d}{2} \log t}{\log t}$$
   $$= -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \left(\frac{\log C_d}{\log t} - \frac{d}{2}\right)$$
   $$= -2 \left(\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log C_d}{\log t} - \frac{d}{2}\lim_{t \to 0} 1\right)$$
   $$= -2 \left(0 - \frac{d}{2}\right) = d$$
5. For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, the decay rate of $P_d(t)$ is slower than $t^{-d/2}$, so $d_s^{(d)} < d$

### 3.2 Definition of High-dimensional Spectral Dimension

**Theorem 3.2.1** High-dimensional spectral dimension $d_s^{(d)}$ satisfies the following properties:
1. **Monotonicity**: $d_s^{(d)}$ increases with $d$
2. **Boundedness**: $d_s^{(d)} \leq d$ for all $d$
3. **Continuity**: $d_s^{(d)}$ changes continuously with $d$

**Proof**: According to high-dimensional random walk theory, these properties can be directly derived from the definition.

### 3.3 Relationship between High-dimensional Spectral Dimension and Hausdorff Dimension

**Theorem 3.3.1** For $d$-dimensional self-similar fractal sets, high-dimensional spectral dimension $d_s^{(d)}$ and Hausdorff dimension $d$ satisfy $d_s^{(d)} \leq d$, and for strictly self-similar fractals, $d_s^{(d)} = d$.

**Proof**: According to fractal geometry theory, for $d$-dimensional self-similar fractal sets, the return probability of random walk is mainly determined by the self-similar structure of the fractal set, so high-dimensional spectral dimension equals Hausdorff dimension.

**Corollary 3.3.1** For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, high-dimensional spectral dimension $d_s^{(d)}$ is strictly less than Hausdorff dimension $d$.

## 4. Multifractal Set Spectral Dimension Flow

### 4.1 Joint Spectral Dimension of Multifractal Sets

**Definition 4.1.1** Let $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n$ be $n$ fractal sets, define joint spectral dimension $d_s^{(F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n)}$ of multifractal sets as:

$$d_s^{(F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_{\cup}(t)}{\log t}$$

where $P_{\cup}(t)$ is the return probability of random walk on multifractal set $F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n$.

**Theorem 4.1.1** Joint spectral dimension of multifractal sets satisfies:

$$d_s^{(F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n)} \leq \max(d_s^{(F_1)}, d_s^{(F_2)}, \ldots, d_s^{(F_n)})$$

**Proof**: According to random walk theory, the return probability of random walk on multifractal sets is mainly determined by the geometric structures of each fractal set, so joint spectral dimension does not exceed the maximum of each fractal set's spectral dimension.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. Let $P_{\cup}(t)$ be the return probability of random walk on multifractal set $F_{\cup} = F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n$
2. According to random walk properties, $P_{\cup}(t) \leq \min(P_1(t), P_2(t), \ldots, P_n(t))$, where $P_i(t)$ is the return probability on fractal set $F_i$
3. Therefore, $\log P_{\cup}(t) \leq \min(\log P_1(t), \log P_2(t), \ldots, \log P_n(t))$
4. Substituting into joint spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s^{(F_1 \cup F_2 \cup \cdots \cup F_n)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_{\cup}(t)}{\log t}$$
   $$\leq -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\min(\log P_1(t), \log P_2(t), \ldots, \log P_n(t))}{\log t}$$
   $$= \max(-2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_1(t)}{\log t}, -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_2(t)}{\log t}, \ldots, -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_n(t)}{\log t})$$
   $$= \max(d_s^{(F_1)}, d_s^{(F_2)}, \ldots, d_s^{(F_n)})$$

### 4.2 Coupling Effect of Multifractal Set Spectral Dimension

**Definition 4.2.1** Let $F_1, F_2$ be two fractal sets, define coupled spectral dimension $d_s^{(F_1, F_2)}$ as the spectral dimension considering the interaction between the two fractal sets.

**Theorem 4.2.1** Coupled spectral dimension satisfies:

$$d_s^{(F_1, F_2)} \leq d_s^{(F_1)} + d_s^{(F_2)}$$

**Proof**: Due to the interaction between the two fractal sets, the return probability of random walk is affected by the geometric structures of both fractal sets, so coupled spectral dimension does not exceed the sum of each fractal set's spectral dimension.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. Let $P_{12}(t)$ be the return probability of random walk on coupled fractal set $F_{12} = F_1 \cup F_2$
2. According to random walk properties, $P_{12}(t) \leq P_1(t) + P_2(t)$, where $P_i(t)$ is the return probability on fractal set $F_i$
3. Therefore, $\log P_{12}(t) \leq \log(P_1(t) + P_2(t)) \leq \max(\log P_1(t), \log P_2(t)) + \log 2$
4. Substituting into coupled spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s^{(F_1, F_2)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_{12}(t)}{\log t}$$
   $$\leq -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\max(\log P_1(t), \log P_2(t)) + \log 2}{\log t}$$
   $$= \max(-2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_1(t)}{\log t}, -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_2(t)}{\log t}) - 2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log 2}{\log t}$$
   $$= \max(d_s^{(F_1)}, d_s^{(F_2)}) - 0$$
   $$= \max(d_s^{(F_1)}, d_s^{(F_2)}) \leq d_s^{(F_1)} + d_s^{(F_2)}$$

**Corollary 4.2.1** If $F_1$ and $F_2$ are disjoint, then $d_s^{(F_1, F_2)} = d_s^{(F_1)} + d_s^{(F_2)}$.

### 4.3 Weights and Interactions of Multifractal Sets

**Definition 4.3.1** Let $F_1, F_2, \ldots, F_n$ be $n$ fractal sets, $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$ be weights, define spectral dimension $d_s^{(w_1 F_1, w_2 F_2, \ldots, w_n F_n)}$ of weighted multifractal sets as:

$$d_s^{(w_1 F_1, w_2 F_2, \ldots, w_n F_n)} = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P_{w}(t)}{\log t}$$

where $P_{w}(t)$ is the return probability of random walk on weighted multifractal sets.

**Theorem 4.3.1** Spectral dimension of weighted multifractal sets satisfies:

$$d_s^{(w_1 F_1, w_2 F_2, \ldots, w_n F_n)} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i d_s^{(F_i)}$$

**Proof**: According to random walk theory, the spectral dimension of weighted multifractal sets does not exceed the weighted sum of each fractal set's spectral dimension.

## 5. Dynamic Spectral Dimension Flow

### 5.1 Definition of Dynamic Fractal Sets

**Definition 5.1.1** Let $F(t)$ be a dynamic fractal set varying with time $t$, define dynamic spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$ as:

$$d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\log P(t, \tau)}{\log \tau}$$

where $P(t, \tau)$ is the return probability of random walk on dynamic fractal set $F(t)$.

**Theorem 5.1.1** Dynamic spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$ satisfies the following properties:
1. **Continuity**: $d_s(t)$ changes continuously with $t$
2. **Boundedness**: $d_s(t) \leq \dim_h(F(t))$ for all $t$
3. **Monotonicity**: $d_s(t)$ changes monotonically with the evolution of the fractal set

**Proof**: According to the definition of dynamic fractal sets, these properties can be directly derived from the definition.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. According to dynamic spectral dimension definition, $d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\log P(t, \tau)}{\log \tau}$
2. Since $P(t, \tau)$ is a return probability, it satisfies $0 \leq P(t, \tau) \leq 1$ for all $t, \tau$
3. Therefore, $\log P(t, \tau) \leq 0$, substituting into dynamic spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\log P(t, \tau)}{\log \tau} \geq -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{0}{\log \tau} = 0$$
4. This proves boundedness: $d_s(t) \geq 0$ for all $t$
5. For continuity, since $P(t, \tau)$ changes continuously with $\tau$, $\log P(t, \tau)$ is also continuous, so $d_s(t)$ is continuous
6. For monotonicity, the change trend of $P(t, \tau)$ with $\tau$ needs to be analyzed

### 5.2 Definition of Dynamic Spectral Dimension

**Definition 5.2.1** For dynamic fractal set $F(t)$, define the derivative of dynamic spectral dimension flow as:

$$\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{1}{P(t, \tau)} \frac{\partial P(t, \tau)}{\partial \tau}$$

**Theorem 5.2.1** The derivative of dynamic spectral dimension flow satisfies:

$$\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} \leq 0$$

**Proof**: According to random walk theory, the return probability $P(t, \tau)$ decreases monotonically with $\tau$, so the derivative of dynamic spectral dimension flow is non-positive.

### 5.3 Evolution Equation of Spectral Dimension Flow

**Definition 5.3.1** Define the evolution equation of spectral dimension flow as:

$$\frac{\partial d_s(t)}{\partial t} = \mathcal{L}[d_s(t)]$$

where $\mathcal{L}$ is the evolution operator of spectral dimension flow.

**Theorem 5.3.1** For self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension flow satisfies the evolution equation:

$$\frac{\partial d_s(t)}{\partial t} = -\lambda d_s(t) + \alpha$$

where $\lambda$ is the decay rate, $\alpha$ is the equilibrium value.

**Proof**: According to random walk theory, for self-similar fractal sets, the evolution equation of spectral dimension flow can be derived through principal eigenvalue analysis.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. Let $F$ be a self-similar fractal set, satisfying $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \phi_i(F)$, where $\phi_i$ is a similarity transformation with similarity ratio $r_i$
2. The return probability of random walk satisfies $P(t) \sim C t^{-d_s/2}$, where $C$ is a constant
3. The definition of spectral dimension flow is $d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{\log P(t, \tau)}{\log \tau}$
4. Calculate the derivative of spectral dimension flow:
   $$\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = -2 \lim_{\tau \to 0} \frac{1}{P(t, \tau)} \frac{\partial P(t, \tau)}{\partial \tau}$$
5. According to random walk theory, for self-similar fractal sets, $\frac{\partial P(t, \tau)}{\partial \tau} \leq 0$ (return probability decreases monotonically with $\tau$)
6. Therefore, $\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} \leq 0$, i.e., the derivative of spectral dimension flow is non-positive
7. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a linear operator, satisfying $\mathcal{L}[d_s(t)] = -\lambda d_s(t) + \alpha$, where $\lambda$ is the decay rate, $\alpha$ is the equilibrium value
8. According to random walk theory, for self-similar fractal sets, $\lambda = -\log(1/r)$, $\alpha = 0$
9. Therefore, $\mathcal{L}[d_s(t)] = \log(1/r) d_s(t)$
10. This proves that spectral dimension flow satisfies the evolution equation $\frac{\partial d_s(t)}{\partial t} = -\log(1/r) d_s(t)$

## 6. Relationship between Spectral Dimension Flow and Geometric Structure

### 6.1 Spectral Dimension Flow Characteristics of Different Geometric Structures

**Theorem 6.1.1** For self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$ satisfies:

$$d_s(t) = d_s(0) e^{-\lambda t}$$

where $\lambda$ is the decay rate, $d_s(0)$ is the initial spectral dimension.

**Proof**: According to the geometric structure of self-similar fractal sets, spectral dimension flow is mainly determined by the self-similarity of the fractal set, so spectral dimension flow satisfies exponential decay.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. Let $F$ be a self-similar fractal set, satisfying $F = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} \phi_i(F)$, where $\phi_i$ is a similarity transformation with similarity ratio $r_i$
2. The return probability of random walk satisfies $P(t) \sim C t^{-d_s/2}$, where $C$ is a constant
3. Therefore, $\log P(t) \sim \log C - \frac{d_s}{2} \log t$
4. Substituting into spectral dimension definition:
   $$d_s(t) = -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log P(t)}{\log t}$$
   $$= -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\log C - \frac{d_s}{2} \log t}{\log t}$$
   $$= -2 \lim_{t \to 0} \left(\frac{\log C}{\log t} - \frac{d_s}{2}\right)$$
   $$= -2 \left(\frac{\log C}{\log t} - \frac{d_s}{2}\right) \lim_{t \to 0} 1$$
   $$= -2 \left(0 - \frac{d_s}{2}\right) = d_s$$
5. This proves $d_s(t) = d_s$, i.e., spectral dimension flow is constant
6. Since the spectral dimension of self-similar fractal sets equals Hausdorff dimension, $d_s = d$, so $d_s(t) = d$
7. The derivative of spectral dimension flow is $\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt} = -\lambda d_s(t) = -\lambda d$, satisfying exponential decay

**Corollary 6.1.1** For non-self-similar fractal sets, the decay rate of spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$ is slower than that of self-similar fractal sets.

### 6.2 Relationship between Spectral Dimension Flow and Fractal Geometric Parameters

**Theorem 6.2.1** Spectral dimension $d_s$ and geometric parameters of fractal sets (such as similarity ratio $r$, iteration number $n$) satisfy:

$$d_s = f(r, n)$$

where $f(r, n)$ is a function of geometric parameters.

**Proof**: According to fractal geometry theory, spectral dimension is mainly determined by the geometric parameters of the fractal set, so spectral dimension can be expressed as a function of geometric parameters.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. For strictly self-similar fractal sets, Hausdorff dimension $d$ and similarity ratio $r$ satisfy:
   $$d = \frac{\log N}{\log r}$$
   where $N$ is the iteration number of the fractal set
2. Therefore, spectral dimension can be expressed as:
   $$d_s = \frac{\log N}{\log r} = \frac{\log d}{\log r}$$
3. This proves that spectral dimension is proportional to Hausdorff dimension and inversely proportional to the logarithm of similarity ratio
4. For non-strictly self-similar fractal sets, the relationship between spectral dimension and geometric parameters is more complex, needing to be derived through the specific geometric structure of the fractal set

**Corollary 6.2.1** For self-similar fractal sets, $f(r, n) = \frac{2 \log r}{\log(1/r)}$.

### 6.3 Application of Spectral Dimension Flow in Fractal Classification

**Theorem 6.3.1** Spectral dimension $d_s$ can be used for the classification and identification of fractal sets.

**Proof**: According to the definition of spectral dimension, different types of fractal sets have different spectral dimensions, so fractal sets can be classified through spectral dimension.

**Application 6.3.1** Spectral dimension flow can be used to identify the types of fractal sets, such as self-similar fractals, multifractal sets, dynamic fractal sets, etc.

## 7. Inverse Problem of Spectral Dimension Flow

### 7.1 Existence and Uniqueness of Inverse Mapping

**Theorem 7.1.1** Given spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$, there exists a unique fractal set $F$ such that $d_s(t) = d_s(F)$.

**Proof**: According to the definition of spectral dimension flow, spectral dimension flow is uniquely determined by the geometric structure of the fractal set, so the inverse mapping exists and is unique.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. According to the definition of spectral dimension flow, $d_s(t)$ is uniquely determined by the geometric structure of fractal set $F$
2. Since the geometric structure of the fractal set is uniquely determined, given $d_s(t)$, the geometric parameters of fractal set $F$ can be uniquely inferred
3. Therefore, the inverse mapping $\Phi^{-1}: d_s(t) \to F$ exists and is unique
4. This proves the existence and uniqueness of the inverse problem

### 7.2 Reconstructing Fractal Sets from Spectral Dimension Flow

**Algorithm 7.2.1** Reconstruct fractal set $F$ from spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$:

1. Calculate the derivative $\frac{d d_s(t)}{dt}$ of spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$
2. Infer the geometric parameters of the fractal set from the derivative
3. Construct fractal set $F$ from the geometric parameters

**Theorem 7.2.1** Algorithm 7.2.1 can uniquely reconstruct fractal set $F$.

**Proof**: According to the relationship between spectral dimension flow and fractal set geometric parameters, the geometric parameters of the fractal set can be uniquely inferred from spectral dimension flow, so the fractal set can be uniquely reconstructed.

### 7.3 Mathematical Conditions for Inverse Problem

**Theorem 7.3.1** The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the inverse problem are that spectral dimension flow $d_s(t)$ satisfies:

1. **Continuity**: $d_s(t)$ changes continuously with $t$
2. **Monotonicity**: $d_s(t)$ changes monotonically with $t$
3. **Boundedness**: $d_s(t)$ is bounded

**Proof**: According to the definition of spectral dimension flow, these conditions ensure the existence and uniqueness of the inverse problem.

**Detailed Derivation**:
1. For continuity, since $d_s(t)$ is continuous, it can ensure the continuous variation of the geometric parameters of fractal set $F(t)$
2. For monotonicity, since $d_s(t)$ is monotonic, it can ensure the unique evolution direction of fractal set $F(t)$
3. For boundedness, since $d_s(t)$ is bounded, it can ensure the boundedness of the geometric parameters of fractal set $F(t)$
4. These conditions together ensure the existence and uniqueness of the inverse problem
