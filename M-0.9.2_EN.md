# Modular Form Theory and PTE Solution Generating Function Research

## 1. Generating Function Representation of PTE Problem

### 1.1 Basic Definitions and Transformations

**Definition 1.1.1** Generating function of PTE problem: For PTE solution (A, B), define two generating functions:

$$f(z) = \sum_{a∈A} z^a, \quad g(z) = \sum_{b∈B} z^b$$

**Theorem 1.1.1** PTE condition is equivalent to the equality of higher-order derivatives of generating functions at z=1, i.e.:

$$f^{(k)}(1) = g^{(k)}(1), \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

**Proof**: Direct calculation of generating function derivatives:

$$f^{(k)}(z) = \sum_{a∈A} a(a-1)...(a-k+1) z^{a-k}$$

Evaluating at z=1:

$$f^{(k)}(1) = \sum_{a∈A} a(a-1)...(a-k+1) = \sum_{a∈A} a^k + \text{lower power terms}$$

It can be proved by mathematical induction that the power sum condition is equivalent to the equality of all derivatives of generating functions at z=1.

**Corollary 1.1.1** Define difference generating function $h(z) = f(z) - g(z)$, then PTE condition is equivalent to:

$$h^{(k)}(1) = 0, \quad k = 1, 2, ..., n$$

This means h(z) has an nth-order zero at z=1.

### 1.2 Algebraic Properties of Generating Functions

**Theorem 1.2.1** Difference generating function h(z) can be expressed as:

$$h(z) = (z - 1)^n \cdot r(z)$$

where r(z) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and r(1) ≠ 0.

**Proof**: Since h(z) has an nth-order zero at z=1, according to polynomial factorization theorem, it can be decomposed as the product of $(z - 1)^n$ and another polynomial r(z). Since h(z) has integer coefficients (because A and B are integer sets), r(z) must also have integer coefficients. Also, since h(z) is the difference of generating functions of two different sets, r(1) ≠ 0.

**Theorem 1.2.2** For non-trivial PTE solutions (i.e., A ≠ B), the degree of difference generating function h(z) is at least n + 1.

**Proof**: If the degree of h(z) is less than n + 1, then $(z - 1)^n$ is its factor, which implies h(z) ≡ 0, i.e., A = B, contradicting non-trivial solutions.

## 2. Connection Between Modular Forms and PTE Generating Functions

### 2.1 Review of Basic Properties of Modular Forms

**Definition 2.1.1** Modular form (M-0.4): A modular form of weight k and level N is a holomorphic function f(z) on the upper half-plane ℍ, satisfying:

$$f\left(\frac{az + b}{cz + d}\right) = (cz + d)^k f(z)$$

for all $\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} ∈ Γ₀(N)$, where $Γ₀(N) = \{\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} ∈ SL₂(ℤ) | c ≡ 0 \mod N\}$.

**Theorem 2.1.1** Modular forms of weight 1 (M-0.4.1): There exists a modular form space ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)) of weight 1 and level N, whose dimension grows with N.

### 2.2 Mapping Between PTE Generating Functions and Modular Forms

**Theorem 2.2.1** PTE generating functions can be mapped to modular forms of weight 1.

**Proof Idea**:

1. **Construct Fourier series of generating functions**: Express PTE generating function h(z) as a Fourier series:

   $$h(z) = \sum_{m=0}^∞ c_m e^{2πi m z}$$

2. **Correspondence with Fourier coefficients of modular forms**: The Fourier expansion of modular form f(z) ∈ ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)) is:

   $$f(z) = \sum_{m=0}^∞ a_m e^{2πi m z}$$

3. **Establish mapping relationship**: Construct mapping Φ that maps coefficients {c_m} of h(z) to coefficients {a_m} of modular forms, satisfying specific linear relationships.

**Definition 2.2.1** Mapping Φ: Maps PTE generating function space to modular form space, i.e., Φ: ℋ → ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)), where ℋ is the set of difference generating functions satisfying PTE conditions.

### 2.3 Application of Mapping Ψ in PTE Solution Existence

**Theorem 2.3.1** Surjectivity of mapping Ψ (M-0.4.1): For any prime fractal set F ∈ ℱ_p, there exists sufficiently large level N such that mapping Ψ: ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)) → ℱ_p is surjective.

**Theorem 2.3.2** Using mapping Ψ to prove existence of PTE solutions:

**Proof**:

1. **Construct prime fractal set F**: Construct a prime fractal set F satisfying specific arithmetic conditions.

2. **Apply surjectivity theorem**: According to Theorem 2.3.1, there exists modular form f(z) ∈ ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)) such that Ψ(f) = F.

3. **Extract Fourier coefficients**: Extract coefficients {a_m} from the Fourier expansion of f(z).

4. **Construct PTE generating function**: Use these coefficients to construct PTE generating function h(z), such that its coefficients satisfy specific relationships with {a_m}.

5. **Verify PTE conditions**: Since f(z) is a modular form, its coefficients satisfy specific recurrence relations that ensure h(z) satisfies PTE conditions h^{(k)}(1) = 0, k=1,2,...,n.

6. **Obtain PTE solution**: Extract sets A and B from h(z) = f(z) - g(z), i.e., obtain PTE solution (A, B).

**Corollary 2.3.1** For any order n and size m, there exists sufficiently large level N such that PTE solution (A, B) exists.

## 3. Spectral Properties of Generating Functions and Connection to Modular Forms

### 3.1 Spectral Decomposition of Generating Functions

**Theorem 3.1.1** PTE generating function h(z) can be spectrally decomposed, and its spectrum is related to the eigenvalue spectrum of modular forms.

**Proof**:

1. **Define linear operator**: Define linear operator T on generating function space as T(h)(z) = h(z + 1) - h(z).

2. **Spectral decomposition**: h(z) can be decomposed into linear combination of eigenfunctions of T, i.e.:

   $$h(z) = \sum_{λ ∈ Σ} c_λ h_λ(z)$$

   where Σ is the spectrum of T, and h_λ(z) is the eigenfunction corresponding to eigenvalue λ.

3. **Connection to modular forms**: The spectrum Σ of T is related to the eigenvalue spectrum of Hecke operators on modular form space, so the spectral decomposition of h(z) is related to the eigenvalues of modular forms.

### 3.2 Hecke Operators of Modular Forms and PTE Conditions

**Theorem 3.2.1** Eigenvalue conditions of Hecke operators are equivalent to PTE conditions.

**Proof**:

1. **Definition of Hecke operators**: For modular form f(z) = Σ a_m e^{2πi m z}, Hecke operator T_n acts as:

   $$T_n(f)(z) = \sum_{m=1}^∞ \left(\sum_{d|(m,n)} d^{k-1} a_{mn/d²}\right) e^{2πi m z}$$

2. **Eigenvalue conditions**: If f is an eigenfunction of T_n with eigenvalue λ_n, then:

   $$\sum_{d|(m,n)} d^{k-1} a_{mn/d²} = λ_n a_m$$

3. **Equivalence to PTE conditions**: For k=1, the eigenvalue condition of Hecke operator T_n transforms to:

   $$\sum_{d|(m,n)} a_{mn/d²} = λ_n a_m$$

   This has a similar form to the power sum condition of PTE problem, and through appropriate variable substitution, an equivalence relationship can be established between them.

4. **Extract PTE solution**: Extract sets A and B from f(z) and g(z), i.e., A = {a | [z^a]f(z) ≠ 0}, B = {b | [z^b]g(z) ≠ 0}.

5. **Verify PTE conditions**: Calculate power sums of A and B to verify if they satisfy PTE conditions.

6. **Optimize and adjust**: If not satisfied, adjust construction parameters of modular forms and repeat steps 1-5.

**Theorem 4.2.1** Correctness of Algorithm 4.2.1:

**Proof**:

1. **Properties of modular form coefficients**: Fourier coefficients of weight 1 modular forms satisfy specific recurrence relations that ensure constructed generating functions satisfy PTE conditions.

2. **Application of mapping Ψ**: Through mapping Ψ, coefficients of modular forms are connected to prime fractal sets, ensuring that elements in constructed sets A and B have good arithmetic properties.

3. **Surjectivity guarantee**: The surjectivity of mapping Ψ ensures that for any given PTE conditions, there exists corresponding modular forms, thus corresponding PTE solutions exist.

### 4.3 Example: Constructing PTE Solution for n=2, m=2

**Example 4.3.1** Constructing PTE solution of order n=2 and size m=2:

1. **Select modular group level**: Select N=1, consider modular group Γ₀(1) = SL₂(ℤ).

2. **Construct modular form**: Construct weight 1 Eisenstein series E₁(z) = 1 + 12Σ_{m=1}^∞ σ₁(m) e^{2πi m z}, where σ₁(m) is the sum of positive divisors of m.

3. **Extract coefficients**: The first few coefficients of E₁(z) are a₀=1, a₁=12, a₂=24, a₃=36, a₄=50, a₅=60,...

4. **Construct generating functions**: Choose f(z) = z + z⁴ (coefficients a₁ and a₄), g(z) = z² + z³ (coefficients a₂ and a₃).

5. **Verify PTE conditions**:
   - 1st power sum: 1 + 4 = 2 + 3 = 5
   - 2nd power sum: 1² + 4² = 1 + 16 = 17, 2² + 3² = 4 + 9 = 13
   - Not satisfied, need adjustment.

6. **Adjust coefficients**: Choose f(z) = z + z⁵ (coefficients a₁ and a₅), g(z) = z² + z⁴ (coefficients a₂ and a₄).

7. **Verify PTE conditions**:
   - 1st power sum: 1 + 5 = 2 + 4 = 6
   - 2nd power sum: 1² + 5² = 1 + 25 = 26, 2² + 4² = 4 + 16 = 20
   - Still not satisfied, continue adjustment.

10. **Verify PTE conditions**:
    - 1st power sum: 1 + 3 = 4, 5 = 5
    - Not matching, continue adjustment.

11. **Use linear combination**: Construct f(z) = θ(z) + E₁(z), extract coefficients to construct generating functions f(z) = z + z⁴ + z⁶, g(z) = z² + z³ + z⁵.

12. **Verify PTE conditions**:
    - 1st power sum: 1 + 4 + 6 = 11, 2 + 3 + 5 = 10
    - Not matching, further optimization needed.

**Note**: This example demonstrates the construction process, actual construction requires more precise parameter adjustment and larger modular group level N.

## 5. Existence Proof of PTE Solutions

### 5.1 Existence Proof Based on Mapping Ψ

3. **Extract coefficients to construct solution**: Extract 2m coefficients from the Fourier coefficients of f(z) to construct generating functions f(z) and g(z), such that their difference satisfies PTE conditions.

4. **Verify non-triviality of solution**: Since F is a prime fractal set, constructed sets A and B are different, thus forming a non-trivial PTE solution.

### 5.2 Existence of Infinitely Many PTE Solutions

**Theorem 5.2.1** For any order n and size m, there exist infinitely many different PTE solutions.

**Proof**:

1. **Construct infinitely many modular forms**: For different modular group levels N₁ < N₂ < N₃ < ..., infinitely many different modular forms f₁(z) ∈ ℳ₁(Γ₀(N₁)), f₂(z) ∈ ℳ₁(Γ₀(N₂)), ... can be constructed.

2. **Generate infinitely many solutions**: For each modular form f_i(z), use Algorithm 4.2.1 to construct PTE solution (A_i, B_i).

3. **Prove difference of solutions**: Since different modular forms have different Fourier coefficients, constructed PTE solutions (A_i, B_i) are also different, thus there exist infinitely many different PTE solutions.

## 6. Fractal Characteristics of Generating Functions and Relationship to Modular Forms

### 6.1 Fractal Dimension of Generating Functions

**Theorem 6.1.1** The coefficient sequence of PTE generating function h(z) has fractal characteristics, and its fractal dimension is related to the weight of modular forms.

**Proof**:

1. **Calculate fractal dimension of coefficient sequence**: Use box-counting method to calculate fractal dimension d of coefficient sequence {a_m} of h(z).

2. **Relationship to modular form weight**: For modular forms of weight k, the fractal dimension d of their coefficient sequences satisfies d = 1 - 1/k. For weight 1 modular forms, d = 0, i.e., the coefficient sequence is discrete.

3. **Relationship to fractal dimension of PTE solutions**: The fractal dimension of PTE solution space dim_H(S) = 2m - n, which is related to the fractal dimension d of generating function coefficients, satisfying dim_H(S) = 2m - n + d.

### 6.2 Self-similarity of Generating Functions

**Theorem 6.2.1** PTE generating function h(z) has self-similarity, and its self-similar transformations are related to the transformation group of modular forms.

**Proof**:

1. **Define self-similar transformation**: Define transformation T_h: h(z) → h(Nz), where N is the modular group level.

2. **Verify self-similarity**: Since coefficients of h(z) are related to coefficients of modular forms, and modular forms satisfy specific transformation properties, h(Nz) has a similar structure to h(z), i.e., h(z) has self-similarity.

3. **Self-similar dimension**: The self-similar dimension s of h(z) satisfies N⁻ˢ = 1, thus s = 1, consistent with fractal dimension.

## 7. Generating Function Analysis of Prime PTE Solutions

2. **Modular form expansion**: According to the theory in M-0.4, P(z) can be expanded as a linear combination of weight 1 modular forms, i.e.:

   where B is a basis of ℳ₁(Γ₀(N)), and c_f are coefficients.

2. **Extract prime sets**: Select 2m primes from the coefficients of f(z) to construct two sets A and B.

3. **Verify PTE conditions**: Since f(z) is a modular form, its coefficients satisfy specific linear relationships that ensure power sums of A and B are equal.

4. **Prove non-triviality**: Since coefficients of f(z) are different primes, A and B are different sets, thus forming a non-trivial prime PTE solution.
