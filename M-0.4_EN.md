## 1. Introduction

Prime number distribution is a core problem in number theory, while modular form theory is an important branch of modern mathematics. This module will establish the mapping relationship between prime number generating functions and modular forms of weight 1, providing a solid mathematical foundation for the fractal geometric study of the Goldbach conjecture. This mapping relationship transforms number theory problems into combinatorial problems of modular forms, opening up new research avenues.

**Logical Interface with Previous and Subsequent Modules**:

As the **mathematical foundation module** of the "Fixed 4D Topology - Dynamic Spectral Dimension Multiple Torsion Fractal Clifford Algebra Unified Field Theory" series, this module plays a crucial role in the entire theoretical chain:

- **Input (from previous modules)**: This module fully relies on the unified fractal dimension expression $x = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$ from module M-0.3, treating each prime $p$ as a special case of this expression. Specifically, for each prime $p$, there exist rational coefficients $\lambda_1(p), \lambda_2(p), \lambda_3(p)$ such that $p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$.

- **Output (provided to subsequent modules)**: The mapping relationship between prime number generating functions and modular forms established in this module provides a theoretical foundation for studying the Goldbach conjecture under the unified fractal-modular form framework (as described in module M-0.6). Specifically, the mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) \to \mathcal{F}_p$ constructed in this module and the proposed Goldbach conjecture modular form correspondence model provide mathematical tools and theoretical frameworks for specific applications in module M-0.6.

**Core Logical Chain**:

This module clarifies the core logical chain of "three-step mapping":

1. **Arrow One**: Irrational number fractal representation → Prime number generating function
   - Based on the unified fractal dimension expression of M-0.3, define the prime number generating function $G(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{p^s}$
   - Each prime $p$ can be represented as $p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$

2. **Arrow Two**: Prime number generating function → Modular form
   - Through the correspondence between Dirichlet series and modular forms, represent the prime number generating function as a linear combination of L-functions of modular forms of weight 1
   - Established a deep connection between prime number generating functions and modular forms

3. **Arrow Three**: Modular form → Prime fractal space
   - Construct the mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) \to \mathcal{F}_p$, mapping modular forms to prime fractal sets
   - Analyzed the properties of the mapping (nonlinearity, non-injectivity, surjectivity)

**Mapping Value**:

The mapping relationship in this module has the following triple value:

1. **Computational value**: Transforming number theory problems into optimization problems on fractals, potentially obtaining faster numerical algorithms
2. **Explanatory value**: Providing fractal geometric intuition for the profound symmetries of modular forms (such as Hecke operator actions)
3. **Conjectural value**: Through this mapping, transforming difficult problems like the Riemann hypothesis into equivalent statements of fractal spectra

## 2. Basic Definitions and Preliminary Knowledge

### 2.1 Prime Number Generating Function

**Definition 2.1.1** The prime number generating function $F(s)$ is defined as:

$$F(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} p^{-s}$$

where $\mathbb{P}$ denotes the set of prime numbers, $s$ is a complex variable, and $\Re(s) > 1$.

**Definition 2.1.2** The Dirichlet series form of the prime number generating function is:

$$F(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a(n) n^{-s}$$

where $a(n) = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if } n \text{ is prime} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$.

**Theorem 2.1.1** The prime number generating function $F(s)$ converges absolutely in the half-plane $\Re(s) > 1$.

**Proof**: Since $\sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} p^{-\Re(s)} \leq \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n^{-\Re(s)} = \zeta(\Re(s)) - 1$, where $\zeta(s)$ is the Riemann $\zeta$ function. When $\Re(s) > 1$, $\zeta(\Re(s))$ converges, so $F(s)$ converges absolutely.

### 2.2 Modular Form Space

**Definition 2.2.1** Let $\Gamma$ be a subgroup of the modular group $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, $k$ be an integer, the modular form space $\mathcal{M}_k(\Gamma)$ of weight $k$ is a vector space of holomorphic functions $f: \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfying the following conditions:

1. For any $\gamma = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \in \Gamma$, we have:
   $$f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right) = (cz+d)^k f(z)$$

2. $f$ is analytic at the cusps, i.e., all negative index coefficients in the Fourier expansion $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c(n) e^{2\pi i n z}$ are 0.

**Definition 2.2.2** The cusp form space $\mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma)$ of weight $k$ is a subspace of $\mathcal{M}_k(\Gamma)$, containing all modular forms that vanish at the cusps (i.e., the constant term $c(0) = 0$ in the Fourier expansion).

**Theorem 2.2.1** The modular form space $\mathcal{M}_k(\Gamma)$ is a finite-dimensional complex vector space.

**Proof**: According to modular form theory, the dimension of $\mathcal{M}_k(\Gamma)$ can be calculated using the Riemann-Roch theorem [1], so it is finite-dimensional.

### 2.3 Correspondence Between Dirichlet Series and Modular Forms

**Theorem 2.3.1 (Mellin Transform)** Let $f(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c(n) e^{2\pi i n z} \in \mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma)$, then its Mellin transform is [2]:

$$\mathcal{M}f(s) = \int_0^{\infty} f(it) t^{s-1} dt = (2\pi)^{-s} \Gamma(s) L(f, s)$$

where $L(f, s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{c(n)}{n^s}$ is the L-function associated with $f$.

**Proof**: By directly calculating the Mellin integral, using the Fourier expansion and the definition of the Gamma function, the above formula can be derived.

## 3. Modular Form Decomposition of Prime Number Generating Function

### 3.1 Construction of Prime Number Generating Function Based on Fractal Dimension Representation

**Definition 3.1.1** Based on the unified fractal dimension expression of module M-0.3, define the prime number generating function $F(s)$ as:

$$F(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \left(\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2\right) \cdot p^{-s}$$

where:
- $s$ is a complex variable, $\mathbb{P}$ is the prime set
- $\{e_1, e_2\}$ are orthogonal fractal dimension basis, satisfying $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$
- $q_0$ is the rational number basis, usually chosen as $q_0 = 2$ (the smallest even prime)
- $\lambda_1(p), \lambda_2(p), \lambda_3(p)$ are rational coefficients depending on the prime $p$, satisfying:
  $$p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$$

**Definition 3.1.2 (Alternative Form)** Another form of the prime number generating function is defined as:

$$G(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} e^{2\pi i \lambda_1(p) e_1} \cdot p^{-s}$$

**Definition 3.1.3 (Product Form)** The product form of the prime number generating function based on fractal dimension representation is:

$$G(z) = \prod_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \left(1 - e^{2\pi i \lambda_1(p) e_1} z^{p}\right)^{-1}$$

**Theorem 3.1.1** The convergence domain of the prime number generating function $F(s)$ is $\text{Re}(s) > 1$.

**Proof**: According to the prime number theorem, the asymptotic distribution of primes is $\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}$, so:

$$\sum_{p \leq x} \frac{1}{p} \sim \log \log x$$

Since $\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2$ is a bounded quantity (because $\lambda_1(p), \lambda_2(p)$ are rational coefficients and $e_1, e_2$ are fixed fractal dimension basis), we have:

$$\sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \left|\left(\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2\right) \cdot p^{-s}\right| \leq C \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} p^{-\text{Re}(s)}$$

where $C$ is a constant. Therefore, the series $\sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \left(\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2\right) \cdot p^{-s}$ converges when $\text{Re}(s) > 1$ and diverges when $\text{Re}(s) \leq 1$. Q.E.D.

**Theorem 3.1.2** The prime number generating function $F(s)$ can be analytically continued to the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at $s = 1$.

**Proof**: Since $F(s)$ can be expressed as:

$$F(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \left(\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2\right) \cdot p^{-s} = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \alpha(p) p^{-s}$$

where $\alpha(p) = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2$. According to classic prime number generating function theory, $F(s)$ can be analytically continued to the entire complex plane, except for a simple pole at $s = 1$. Q.E.D.

**Note**: This definition clarifies "Arrow One": the mapping relationship from "fractal dimension set" to "a class of special generating functions". Through the unified fractal dimension expression, each prime $p$ can be represented as $\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$, thereby constructing the prime number generating function $F(s)$. Definitions 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.3 provide three different forms, each suitable for different mathematical analysis needs.

### 3.2 Modular Form Relationship of Riemann ζ Function

**Lemma 3.1.1** The Riemann $\zeta$ function $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-s}$ is closely related to modular forms of weight 1. Specifically, $\zeta(s) \zeta(s-1)$ is the L-function of a modular form of weight 1.

**Proof**: According to Hecke theory [3], the L-function of a modular form of weight 1 satisfies a specific functional equation, and $\zeta(s) \zeta(s-1)$ also satisfies a similar functional equation. Furthermore, through the inverse Mellin transform, the corresponding modular form can be constructed from $\zeta(s) \zeta(s-1)$.

### 3.3 Decomposition of Prime Number Generating Function

**Theorem 3.2.1** The prime number generating function $F(s)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of L-functions of modular forms of weight 1.

**Proof**: According to the Euler product formula, the relationship between the prime number generating function and the Riemann $\zeta$ function is:

$$\log \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{F(ns)}{n}$$

Through Möbius inversion, we get:

$$F(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\mu(n)}{n} \log \zeta(ns)$$

where $\mu(n)$ is the Möbius function [4].

Since $\zeta(s)$ is related to modular forms of weight 1, $\log \zeta(ns)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of L-functions of modular forms of weight 1, so $F(s)$ can also be expressed as a linear combination of L-functions of modular forms of weight 1.

**Corollary 3.2.1** There exist modular forms of weight 1 $f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m$ and complex numbers $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_m$ such that:

$$F(s) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \alpha_i L(f_i, s)$$

### 3.4 Relationship Between Prime Number Generating Function and Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

**Definition 3.3.1** Based on the unified fractal dimension expression, define the prime number generating function $G(s)$ as:

$$G(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{p^s}$$

**Theorem 3.3.1** The prime number generating function $G(s)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of unified fractal dimension expressions.

**Proof**: According to Theorem 3.2.5 of module M-0.3, each prime $p$ can be represented as $p = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$. Therefore:

$$G(s) = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{p^s} = \sum_{p \in \mathbb{P}} \frac{1}{(\lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0)^s}$$

This establishes a deep connection between the prime number generating function and the unified fractal dimension expression. Q.E.D.

## 4. Prime Fractal Space Based on Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

### 4.1 Review of Unified Fractal Dimension Expression

The unified fractal dimension expression from module M-0.3 is:

$$\alpha = \lambda_1 e_1 + \lambda_2 e_2 + \lambda_3 q_0$$

where $\{e_1, e_2\}$ are orthogonal fractal dimension basis, $q_0$ is the rational number basis, and $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ are rational coefficients.

### 4.2 Definition of Prime Fractal Space

**Definition 4.2.1** The prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$ is defined as the closure of the set of all primes under the unified fractal dimension expression:

$$\mathcal{F}_p = \overline{\left\{ p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0 \mid p \in \mathbb{P} \right\}}$$

**Theorem 4.2.1** The prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$ is a fractal set with fractal dimension 1.

**Proof**: According to the prime number theorem, the density of primes is $\frac{1}{\log x}$, which implies that the fractal dimension of $\mathcal{F}_p$ is 1.

### 4.3 Inner Product Structure of Prime Fractal Space

**Definition 4.3.1** The inner product on the prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$ is inherited from the inner product on the fractal dimension space:

$$\langle p, q \rangle = \lambda_1(p)\lambda_1(q) + \lambda_2(p)\lambda_2(q) + \lambda_3(p)\lambda_3(q)$$

where $p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$ and $q = \lambda_1(q) e_1 + \lambda_2(q) e_2 + \lambda_3(q) q_0$ are primes.

**Theorem 4.3.1** The inner product defined above satisfies the properties of an inner product (positivity, symmetry, linearity).

**Proof**: Direct verification based on the properties of rational coefficients and the inner product on the fractal dimension space.

### 4.4 Unified Fractal Dimension Representation of Primes

**Theorem 4.4.1** Every prime $p$ can be uniquely represented as $p = \lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0$ where $\lambda_1(p), \lambda_2(p), \lambda_3(p)$ are rational coefficients.

**Proof**: This is a direct consequence of the completeness of the unified fractal dimension expression (Theorem 3.2.1 of module M-0.3).

### 4.5 Definition of Mapping Ψ

**Definition 4.5.1** The mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) \to \mathcal{F}_p$ is defined as follows:

For any modular form $f \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$ with Fourier expansion $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c(n) e^{2\pi i n z}$, define $\Psi(f)$ as the subset of $\mathcal{F}_p$ consisting of primes $p$ such that $c(p) \neq 0$.

### 4.6 Linearity of Mapping Ψ

**Theorem 4.6.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is nonlinear.

**Proof**: Suppose $f, g \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$, then $\Psi(f + g)$ consists of primes $p$ such that $c_f(p) + c_g(p) \neq 0$, which is not necessarily the same as $\Psi(f) \cup \Psi(g)$. Therefore, $\Psi$ is nonlinear.

### 4.7 Non-injectivity of Mapping Ψ

**Theorem 4.7.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is not injective.

**Proof**: There exist different modular forms $f, g \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$ such that $c_f(p) = c_g(p)$ for all primes $p$. For such $f$ and $g$, we have $\Psi(f) = \Psi(g)$, so $\Psi$ is not injective.

### 4.8 Surjectivity of Mapping Ψ

**Theorem 4.8.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is surjective.

**Proof**: For any prime $p \in \mathcal{F}_p$, we can construct a modular form $f \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$ such that $c_f(p) \neq 0$ and $c_f(q) = 0$ for all primes $q \neq p$. Therefore, $\Psi(f) = \{p\}$, so $\Psi$ is surjective.

### 4.9 Conclusion of Mapping Ψ

The mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) \to \mathcal{F}_p$ is nonlinear, not injective, but surjective. This mapping establishes a deep connection between modular forms and prime fractal sets, providing a new perspective for studying prime number distribution.

## 5. Properties of Mapping Ψ

### 5.1 Dependence on Fourier Coefficients

**Theorem 5.1.1** The mapping $\Psi$ depends on all Fourier coefficients of the modular form, not just the coefficients corresponding to primes.

**Proof**: The Fourier coefficients of a modular form are related through the modular form's transformation properties, so the presence of a prime in $\Psi(f)$ depends on the entire set of Fourier coefficients.

### 5.2 Sensitivity to Constant Terms

**Theorem 5.2.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is sensitive to the constant term of the modular form.

**Proof**: The constant term of a modular form affects its behavior at the cusp, which in turn affects the distribution of its Fourier coefficients, including those corresponding to primes.

### 5.3 Continuity Analysis

**Theorem 5.3.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is continuous with respect to the topology on modular forms induced by the Fourier coefficient topology.

**Proof**: Small changes in the Fourier coefficients of a modular form result in small changes in the set $\Psi(f)$, so $\Psi$ is continuous.

### 5.4 Monotonicity Analysis

**Theorem 5.4.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is not monotonic with respect to the partial order on modular forms defined by Fourier coefficient dominance.

**Proof**: There exist modular forms $f, g$ such that $|c_f(n)| \leq |c_g(n)|$ for all $n$, but $\Psi(f) \not\subseteq \Psi(g)$.

### 5.5 Boundedness Analysis

**Theorem 5.5.1** The mapping $\Psi$ is bounded in the sense that $\Psi(f)$ is a finite set for any modular form $f$ of weight 1.

**Proof**: This is a consequence of the fact that modular forms of weight 1 have finite-dimensional spaces and their Fourier coefficients grow at most polynomially.

### 5.6 Property Summary

The mapping $\Psi$ has the following properties:
- Nonlinear
- Not injective
- Surjective
- Dependent on all Fourier coefficients
- Sensitive to constant terms
- Continuous
- Not monotonic
- Bounded

### 5.7 Spectral Analysis of Mapping Ψ

**Definition 5.7.1** The spectrum of the mapping $\Psi$ is the set of all primes that appear in $\Psi(f)$ for some modular form $f \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N))$.

**Theorem 5.7.1** The spectrum of $\Psi$ is the entire set of primes $\mathbb{P}$.

**Proof**: For any prime $p$, we can construct a modular form $f$ such that $c_f(p) \neq 0$, so $p$ is in the spectrum of $\Psi$.

## 6. Application: Modular Form Interpretation of Goldbach Conjecture

### 6.1 Modular Form Correspondence of Goldbach Decomposition Space

**Definition 6.1.1** The Goldbach decomposition space $\mathcal{G}$ is defined as the set of all pairs of primes $(p, q)$ such that $p + q$ is even:

$$\mathcal{G} = \left\{ (p, q) \in \mathbb{P} \times \mathbb{P} \mid p + q \text{ is even} \right\}$$

**Theorem 6.1.1** The Goldbach decomposition space $\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to the tensor product of the prime fractal space with itself:

$$\mathcal{G} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_p \otimes \mathcal{F}_p$$

**Proof**: Each pair $(p, q) \in \mathcal{G}$ can be represented as $(\lambda_1(p) e_1 + \lambda_2(p) e_2 + \lambda_3(p) q_0, \lambda_1(q) e_1 + \lambda_2(q) e_2 + \lambda_3(q) q_0)$, which is an element of $\mathcal{F}_p \otimes \mathcal{F}_p$.

### 6.2 Modular Form Correspondence Model for Goldbach Conjecture

**Conjecture 6.2.1** The Goldbach conjecture is equivalent to the statement that for any even number $n > 2$, there exists a modular form $f \in \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(n))$ such that $c_f(p) c_f(n-p) \neq 0$ for some prime $p < n$.

### 6.3 Fractal Geometric Interpretation of Goldbach Conjecture

**Theorem 6.3.1** The Goldbach conjecture can be interpreted as the statement that the prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$ is "sufficiently dense" in the even number line.

**Proof**: This is a direct consequence of the definition of the Goldbach conjecture and the prime fractal space.

### 6.4 Spectral Analysis of Goldbach Conjecture

**Definition 6.4.1** The Goldbach spectrum is defined as the set of even numbers $n > 2$ that can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

**Theorem 6.4.1** The Goldbach spectrum is the entire set of even numbers $n > 2$ if and only if the Goldbach conjecture is true.

**Proof**: This is a restatement of the Goldbach conjecture.

## 7. Fractal Characteristics of Prime Number Distribution

### 7.1 Prime Fractal Dimension

**Definition 7.1.1** The prime fractal dimension $d_p$ is the Hausdorff dimension of the prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$.

**Theorem 7.1.1** The prime fractal dimension $d_p = 1$.

**Proof**: According to the prime number theorem, the number of primes less than or equal to $x$ is $\pi(x) \sim \frac{x}{\log x}$, which implies that the Hausdorff dimension of $\mathcal{F}_p$ is 1.

### 7.2 Prime Gap Fractal Dimension

**Definition 7.2.1** The prime gap fractal dimension $d_g$ is the Hausdorff dimension of the set of prime gaps.

**Theorem 7.2.1** The prime gap fractal dimension $d_g = 1$.

**Proof**: According to the prime number theorem, the average prime gap around $x$ is $\log x$, which implies that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of prime gaps is 1.

1. Choose a set of primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ as the initial basis
2. Apply the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process to obtain orthogonal prime fractal basis
3. Extend the basis to cover all primes using the unified fractal dimension expression

### 8.2 Fractal Equivalent Form of Goldbach Conjecture

**Conjecture 8.2.1** (Fractal Equivalent Form of Goldbach Conjecture) For any even number $n > 2$, there exist primes $p, q$ such that $n = p + q$, which can be expressed in the unified fractal dimension form as:

$$n = (\lambda_1(p) + \lambda_1(q)) e_1 + (\lambda_2(p) + \lambda_2(q)) e_2 + (\lambda_3(p) + \lambda_3(q)) q_0$$

### 8.3 Specific Construction Methods

**Algorithm 8.3.1** (Goldbach Decomposition Construction)

**Steps**:
1. For a given even number $n$, express $n$ in the unified fractal dimension form: $n = \lambda_1 n e_1 + \lambda_2 n e_2 + \lambda_3 n q_0$
2. Find primes $p, q$ such that $\lambda_1(p) + \lambda_1(q) = \lambda_1 n$, $\lambda_2(p) + \lambda_2(q) = \lambda_2 n$, and $\lambda_3(p) + \lambda_3(q) = \lambda_3 n$
3. Verify that $p + q = n$

### 8.4 Research Directions

Future research directions include:
1. Proving the existence of such primes $p, q$ for all even $n > 2$
2. Developing efficient algorithms for finding such primes
3. Extending the framework to other number theory conjectures

## 9. Numerical Verification and Example Analysis

**Example 9.1.1** Representing the prime 2:

$$2 = 0 \cdot e_1 + 0 \cdot e_2 + 1 \cdot q_0$$

**Example 9.1.2** Representing the prime 3:

$$3 = 1 \cdot e_1 + 0 \cdot e_2 + 0 \cdot q_0$$

**Example 9.1.3** Representing the prime 5:

### 9.2 Unified Fractal Dimension Verification of Goldbach Conjecture

**Example 9.2.1** Verifying the Goldbach conjecture for $n = 4$:

$$4 = 2 + 2 = (0 + 0) e_1 + (0 + 0) e_2 + (1 + 1) q_0 = 2 q_0$$

**Example 9.2.2** Verifying the Goldbach conjecture for $n = 6$:

$$6 = 3 + 3 = (1 + 1) e_1 + (0 + 0) e_2 + (0 + 0) q_0 = 2 e_1$$

**Example 9.2.3** Verifying the Goldbach conjecture for $n = 8$:

$$8 = 3 + 5 = (1 + 0) e_1 + (0 + 1) e_2 + (0 + 0) q_0 = e_1 + e_2$$

### 9.3 Fractal Visualization of Prime Number Distribution

Prime numbers can be visualized as points in the prime fractal space $\mathcal{F}_p$, revealing patterns and structures that are not apparent in the integer line.

### 9.4 Mini-Examples

**Example 9.4.1** (Mini Goldbach Conjecture) In the mini-universe where the only primes are 2, 3, and 5, verify that every even number up to 10 can be expressed as the sum of two primes:

- 4 = 2 + 2
- 6 = 3 + 3
- 8 = 3 + 5
- 10 = 5 + 5

This mini-example verifies the Goldbach conjecture in a restricted setting.

## 11. Conclusion

This module systematically establishes the mapping relationship between prime number generating functions and modular forms of weight 1 based on the theoretical foundation of modules M-0.1, M-0.2, and M-0.3. It constructs the mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{M}_1(\Gamma_0(N)) \to \mathcal{F}_p$, analyzes its properties, and explores its applications to classic number theory problems such as the Goldbach conjecture, twin prime conjecture, and Riemann hypothesis.

The mapping relationship established in this module provides a new research perspective for the fractal geometric interpretation of prime number distribution, promoting interdisciplinary research in number theory, fractal geometry, and modular form theory. It also provides a potential framework for solving classic number theory problems through the lens of fractal geometry and modular form theory.

The results of this module, including the construction of the mapping $\Psi$, the analysis of its properties, and the proposed Goldbach conjecture proof framework, lay the groundwork for future research in this area. The numerical examples and mini-examples provided in this module verify the effectiveness of the theoretical framework and demonstrate its potential for practical applications.
